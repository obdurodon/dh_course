            <strong>BLITZER:</strong>
         </a> Welcome to the CNN-Facebook Republican presidential debate
                here at the Venetian Las Vegas. We have a very enthusiastic audience. Everyone is
                here. They're looking forward to a serious and spirited discussion about the
                security of this nation. I'm Wolf Blitzer, your moderator tonight. This debate is
                airing on CNN networks here in the United States and around the world, and on the
                Salem Radio Network. The nine leading candidates, they are here. Let's welcome them
                right now. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky. [applause] New Jersey Governor Chris
                Christie. [applause] Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. [applause] Senator Ted Cruz
                of Texas. [applause] Businessman and real estate developer Donald Trump. [applause]
                Retired neurosurgeon, Dr. Ben Carson. [applause] Senator Marco Rubio of Florida.
                [applause] Former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina. [applause] And Ohio Governor
                John Kasich. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome these Republican candidates for president
                of the United States. [applause] This is the final Republican debate before the
                election year begins, and we're taking a moment for the photographs of the
                candidates together on the stage. Now, everyone, please rise for the national anthem
                sung by Ayla Brown. [national anthem] [applause]</p>

         </a> I know everyone is eager to get started. So, candidates,
                please take your places while I explain the ground rules for tonight. As moderator,
                I'll guide the discussion, and I'll be joined in the questioning by Salem Radio
                Network talk show host Hugh Hewitt and CNN's chief political correspondent Dana
                Bash. We also asked Republicans and independents nationwide to share their questions
                for the candidates. We teamed up with Facebook to send a campaign camper across the
                country over the past several weeks. Thousands of people stepped inside and recorded
                their questions on video. Millions more have weighed in on Facebook. Candidates,
                I'll try to make sure each of you gets your fair share of questions. You'll have a
                minute and 15 seconds to answer and 30 seconds for follow-ups and rebuttals. I'll
                give you time to respond if you're singled out for criticism. Our viewers should
                know that we have timing lights that are visible to the candidates to warn them when
                their time is up. And as the candidates requested, a bell will sound like this. We
                know you are all eager to jump in and debate these important issues, so, please,
                wait until you're called on. These nine Republicans are positioned on stage based on
                their ranking in the recent polls, so let's begin right now. I'd like to invite each
                candidate to introduce himself or herself to our audience. You'll have one minute.
                First to you, Senator Paul.</p>

            <strong>PAUL:</strong>
         </a> The question is, how do we keep America safe from terrorism?
                Trump says we ought to close that Internet thing. The question really is, what does
                he mean by that? Like they do in North Korea? Like they do in China? Rubio says we
                should collect all Americans' records all of the time. The Constitution says
                otherwise. I think they're both wrong. I think we defeat terrorism by showing them
                that we do not fear them. I think if we ban certain religions, if we censor the
                Internet, I think that at that point the terrorists will have won. Regime change
                hasn't won. Toppling secular dictators in the Middle East has only led to chaos and
                the rise of radical Islam. I think if we want to defeat terrorism, I think if we
                truly are sincere about defeating terrorism, we need to quit arming the allies of
                ISIS. If we want to defeat terrorism, the boots on the ground — the boots on the
                ground need to be Arab boots on the ground. As commander-in-chief, I will do
                whatever it takes to defend America. But in defending America, we cannot lose what
                America stands for. Today is the Bill of Rights' anniversary. I hope we will
                remember that and cherish that in the fight on terrorism.</p>

            <strong>KASICH:</strong>
         </a> Thank you, Wolf. Just last weekend, just last week, a friend
                asked one of my daughters, "Do you like politics?" And my daughter said, "No, I
                don't. And the reason I don't like it is because there's too much fighting, too much
                yelling. It's so loud, I don't like it." You know, I turned to my friend and I said,
                "You know, she's really on to something." And when we think about our country and
                the big issues that we face in this country; creating jobs, making sure people can
                keep their jobs, the need for rising wages, whether our children when they graduate
                from college can find a job, protecting the homeland, destroying ISIS, rebuilding
                defense. These are all the things that we need to focus on but we'll never get there
                if we're divided. We'll never get there if republicans and democrats just fight with
                one another. Frankly, we are republicans and they're democrats but before all of
                that, we're Americans. And I believe we need to unify in so many ways to rebuild our
                country, to strengthen our country, to rebuild our defense, and for America to
                secure it's place it world; for us, for our children, and for the next generation.

         </a> Thank you Wolf. America has been betrayed. We've been
                betrayed by the leadership that Barack Obama and Hilary Clinton have provided to
                this country over the last number of years. Think about just what's happened today.
                The second largest school district in America in Los Angeles closed based on a
                threat. Think about the effect that, that's going to have on those children when
                they go back to school tomorrow wondering filled with anxiety to whether they're
                really going to be safe. Think about the mothers who will take those children
                tomorrow morning to the bus stop wondering whether their children will arrive back
                on that bus safe and sound. Think about the fathers of Los Angeles, who tomorrow
                will head off to work and wonder about the safety of their wives and their children.
                What is Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton done to this country? That the most basic
                responsibility of an administration is to protect the safety and security of the
                American people. I will tell you this, I'm a former federal prosecutor, I've fought
                terrorists and won and when we get back in the White House we will fight terrorists
                and win again and America will be safe. [applause]</p>

                our nation. Citizens, it's time to take our country back. Bombastic insults wont
                take it back. Political rhetoric that promises a lot and delivers little, won't take
                it back. All of our problems can be solved. All of our wounds can be healed by a
                tested leader who is willing to fight for the character of our nation. I have been
                tested. I have beaten breast cancer. I have buried a child. I started as a
                secretary. I fought my way to the top of corporate America while being called every
                B word in the book. I fought my way into this election and on to this debate stage
                while all the political insiders and the pundits told, "it couldn't be done." I've
                been told, "no,: all my life. And all my life, I've refused to accept no as an
                answer. Citizens, it is time to take our country back from the political class, from
                the media, from the liberal elite. It can be done, it must be done, join me and we
                will get it done. [applause]</p>

                free world to protect our civilized way of life. Serious times require strong
                leadership, that's what at stake right now. Regarding national security, we need to

                before it destroys us. Regarding economic security, we need to take power and money

         </a> Thank you Wolf. It's really amazing to be back in Las Vegas. I
                spent six years as a child growing not far from where we stand tonight. I use to sit
                on the porch of our home and listen to my grandfather tell stories as he smoked one
                of three daily cigars. One of the things my grandfather instilled in me, was that I
                was really blessed because I was a citizen of the greatest country in the history of
                our mankind. But there have always been people in American politics that wanted
                America to be more like the rest of the world. And In 2008, one of them was elected
                president of this country and the result has been a disaster. Today you have
                millions of Americans that feel left out and out of place in their own country,
                struggling to live paycheck to paycheck, called bigots because they hold on to
                traditional values. And around the world, America's influence has declined while
                this president has destroyed our military, our allies no longer trust us, and our
                adversaries no longer respect us. And that is why this election is so important.
                That is why I'm running for president. And that's why I'm going to ask you for your
                vote tonight. If you elect me president, we will have a president that believes
                America is the greatest country in the world and we will have a president that acts
                like it. [applause]</p>

                We have a president who is unwilling to utter its name. The men and women on this

                of the commander-in-chief is to keep America safe. If I am elected president, we
                will hunt down and kill the terrorists. We will utterly destroy ISIS. We will stop
                the terrorist attacks before they occur because we will not be prisoners to

                its inception has been at war, every 15 or 20 years. But the war that we are
                fighting now against radical Islamist jihadists is one that we must win. Our very
                existence is dependent upon that. You know, as a pediatric neurosurgeon, I
                frequently faced life and death situations, and had to come up with the right
                diagnosis, the right plan, and execute that plan frequently with other colleagues.
                Right now, the United States of America is the patient. And the patient is in
                critical condition and will not be cured by political correctness and will not be
                cured by timidity. And I am asking the Congress, which represents the people, to
                declare a war on ISIS so that we can begin the process of excising that cancer and
                begin the healing process, and bring peace, prosperity, and safety back to America.

                America's borders. To keep the country safe, you say you want to temporarily ban
                non-American Muslims from coming to the United States; ban refugees fleeing ISIS
                from coming here; deport 11 million people; and wall off America's southern border.

                That's — that should be our objective. The refugee issue will be solved if we
                destroy ISIS there, which means we need to have a no-fly zone, safe zones there for
                refugees and to build a military force. We need to embed our forces — our troops
                inside the Iraqi military. We need to arm directly the Kurds. And all of that has to
                be done in concert with the Arab nations. And if we're going to ban all Muslims, how
                are we going to get them to be part of a coalition to destroy ISIS? The Kurds are

                to destroy ISIS. So Donald, you know, is great at — at the one-liners, but he's a
                chaos candidate. And he'd be a chaos president. He would not be the commander in

                president hasn't kept us safe. The problem is we had an attack in San Bernardino.
                And we were paying attention to the most important issue we have faced in a decade
                since 9/11, and then all the talk was about this proposal, which isn't going to
                happen. But this is what's important to do is we must deal frontally with this
                threat of radical Islamists, especially from ISIS. This is the most sophisticated
                terror group that has ever threatened the world or the United States of America.
                They are actively recruiting Americans. The attacker in San Bernardino was an
                American citizen, born and raised in this country. He was a health inspector; had a
                newborn child and left all that behind to kill 14 people. We also understand that
                this is a group that's growing in its governance of territory. It's not just Iraq
                and Syria. They are now a predominant group in Libya. They are beginning to pop up
                in Afghanistan. They are increasingly involved now in attacks in Yemen. They have
                Jordan in their sights. This group needs to be confronted with serious proposals.
                And this is a very significant threat we face. And the president has left us unsafe.
                He spoke the other night to the American people to reassure us. I wish he hadn't
                spoken at all. He made things worse. Because what he basically said was we are going
                to keep doing what we're doing now, and what we are doing now is not working.

                double-speak where he doesn't call radical Islamic terrorism by its name. Indeed, he
                gives a speech after the San Bernardino attack where his approach is to try to go
                after the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens rather than to keep us safe.
                And even worse, President Obama and Hillary Clinton are proposing bringing tens of
                thousands of Syrian refugees to this country when the head of the FBI has told
                Congress they cannot vet those refugees. I understand why Donald made that proposal.
                I introduced legislation in the Senate that I believe is more narrowly focused at
                the actual threat, which is radical Islamic terrorism, and what my legislation would

                need to deny them territory. But here at home, we need to do two fundamental things.
                Number one, we need to recognize that technology has moved on. The Patriot Act was
                signed in 2001, roughly. The iPhone was invented in 2007. The iPad was invented in
                2011. Snapchat and Twitter, all the rest of it, have been around just for several
                years. Technology has moved on, and the terrorists have moved on with it. Let me
                tell you a story. Soon after 9/11, I got a phone call from the NSA. They needed
                help. I gave them help. I stopped a truckload of equipment. I had it turned around.
                It was escorted by the NSA into headquarters. We need the private sector's help,
                because government is not innovating. Technology is running ahead by leaps and
                bound. The private sector will help, just as I helped after 9/11. But they must be
                engaged, and they must be asked. I will ask them. I know them. [applause]</p>

                this, as a former federal prosecutor, if a center for the developmentally disabled
                in San Bernardino, California, is now a target for terrorists, that means everywhere

                Hussein from Kuwait. Before we came out here tonight, I am told that the Saudis have
                organized 34 countries who want to join in the battle against terrorism. First and
                foremost, we need to go and destroy ISIS. And we need to do this with our Arab
                friends and our friends in Europe. And when I see they have a climate conference
                over in Paris, they should have been talking about destroying ISIS because they are
                involved in virtually every country, you know, across this world. [applause] Now,
                you destroy ISIS in a coalition. You get joint intelligence with our European
                friends. And then here at home, there are things called the Joint Terrorism Task
                Force, headed by the FBI, and made up of local law enforcement, including state
                police. They need the tools. And the tools involve encryption where we cannot hear
                what they're even planning. And when we see red flags, a father, a mother, a
                neighbor who says we have got a problem here, then we have to give law enforcement
                the ability to listen so they can disrupt these terrorist attacks before they occur.
                We can do this, but we've got to get moving. Pay me now or pay me a lot more later.

                signed into law just this past June that made it harder for the government to access
                Americans' phone records. In light of the San Bernardino attack, was your vote a

         <a href="#CRUZ4">
            <strong>CRUZ:</strong>
         </a> Well, Dana, the premise of your question is not accurate. I'm
                very proud to have joined with conservatives in both the Senate and the House to
                reform how we target bad guys. And what the USA Freedom Act did is it did two
                things. Number one, it ended the federal government's bulk collection of phone
                metadata of millions of law-abiding citizens. But number two in the second half of
                it that is critical. It strengthened the tools of national security and law
                enforcement to go after terrorists. It gave us greater tools and we are seeing those
                tools work right now in San Bernardino. And in particular, what it did is the prior
                program only covered a relatively narrow slice of phone calls. When you had a
                terrorist, you could only search a relatively narrow slice of numbers, primarily
                land lines. The USA Freedom Act expands that so now we have cell phones, now we have
                Internet phones, now we have the phones that terrorists are likely to use and the
                focus of law enforcement is on targeting the bad guys. You know what the Obama
                administration keeps getting wrong is whenever anything bad happens they focus on
                law-abiding citizens instead of focusing on the bad guys. We need to focus on
                radical Islamic terrorists and we need to stop them before they carry out acts of
                terror. [applause]</p>

                opposed at every point increased security — <span class="keyword">border</span>
                security for those who come to our country. On his Gang of Eight bill, he would have
                liberalized <em>immigration</em>, but he did not — and he steadfastly opposed any new
                border security requirements for refugees or students. Last week, I introduced another bill saying we need more
                security, we need more scrutiny. Once again, Marco opposed this. So Marco can't have
                it both ways. He thinks he wants to be this, "Oh, I'm great and strong on national
                defense." But he's the weakest of all the candidates on <em>immigration</em>. He is the one for an open <span class="keyword">border</span> that is leaving us defenseless. If we want to defend the

                    an allegiance to Chuck Schumer and to the liberals than he does to conservative

                issue a subpoena. But now the intelligence agency is not able to quickly gather
                records and look at them to see who these terrorists are calling. And the terrorists
                that attacked us in San Bernardino was an American citizen, born and raised in this

                If your eyes are glazing over like mine, this is what it's like to be on the floor
                of the United States Senate. I mean, endless debates about how many angels on the
                head of a pin from people who've never had to make a consequential decision in an
                executive position. The fact is, for seven years, I had to make these decisions
                after 9/11, make a decision about how to proceed forward with an investigation or
                how to pull back, whether you use certain actionable intelligence or whether not to.
                And yet they continue to debate about this bill and in the subcommittee and what —
                nobody in America cares about that. What they care about is, are we going to have a
                president who actually knows what they're doing to make these decisions? And for the
                seven years afterwards, New Jersey was threatened like no other region in this
                country and what we did was we took action within the constitution to make sure that
                law enforcement had all the information they needed. We prosecuted two of the
                biggest terrorism cases in the world and stopped Fort Dix from being attacked by six
                American radicalized Muslims from a Mosque in New Jersey because we worked with the
                Muslim American community to get intelligence and we used the Patriot Act to get
                other intelligence to make sure we did those cases. This is the difference between
                actually been a federal prosecutor, actually doing something, and not just spending
                your life as one of hundred debating it. Let's talk about how we do this, not about
                which bill, which one these guys like more. The American people don't care about

                to pay attention to that. Now, as far as monitoring is concerned, what my point is,
                we need to make sure that any place – I don't care whether it's a mosque, a school,
                a supermarket, a theater, you know it doesn't matter. If there are a lot of people
                getting there and engaging in radicalizing activities then we need to be suspicious

                somebody's going to say that I'm Islamophobic or what have you. This is craziness
                because we are at war. That's why I asked congress, go ahead and declare the war .
                We need to be on a war footing. We need to understand that our nation is in grave
                danger. You know, what the Muslim Brotherhood said in the explanatory memorandum

            <strong>BUSH:</strong>
         </a> They are relevant if we want to destroy ISIS. If we want to
                destroy radical Islamic terrors, we can't disassociate ourselves from peace loving
                Muslims. If we expect to do this on our own, we will fail but if we do it in unison
                with people who are also are at risk and threatened by Islamic Radical terrorism,
                we'll be far more successful. Look, the FBI has the tools necessary un-American
                activities in our country. It goes on, we shouldn't even be talking about it, to be
                honest with you out in the public. Of course they have those capabilities and we
                should make sure that we give the FBI, the NSA, our intelligence communities, all
                the resources they need to keep us safe. But the main thing we should be focused on
                is the strategy to destroy ISIS. And I laid out a plan that the Reagan Library
                before the tragedy of Paris, and before San Bernardino to do just that. It requires
                leadership, it's not filing an amendment and call it a success. It is developing a
                strategy, leading the world, funding it to make sure that we have a military that's
                second to none, and doing the job and making sure that we destroy ISIS there. That's

                have a lot of argument about laws but none of it solves the problem. Let's examine
                what happened, why did we miss the Tsarnaev brothers, why did we miss the San
                Bernardino couple? It wasn't because we had stopped collected metadata it was
                because, I think, as someone who comes from the technology world, we were using the
                wrong algorithms. This is a place where the private sector could be helpful because
                the government is woefully behind the technology curve. But secondly, the
                bureaucratic processes that have been in place since 9/11 are woefully inadequate as
                well. What do we now know? That DHS vets people by going into databases of known or
                suspected terrorists. And yet, we also know that ISIS is recruiting who are not in
                those databases. So of course, we're going to miss them. And then we now learn that
                DHS says, "No, we can't check their social media." For heaven's sakes, every parent
                in America is checking social media and every employer is as well, but our
                government can't do it. The bureaucratic procedures are so far behind. Our
                government has become incompetent, unresponsive, corrupt. And that incompetence,
                ineptitude, lack of accountability is now dangerous. It is why we need a different
                kind of leadership in the White House that understands how to get bureaucracies

                issues. One is the metadata. We know we have to hold this data for a longer period
                of time. And, you know, in a lot of ways, Chris is right. Look, what a president has
                to do is take a position. We don't want to err on the side of having less. We want
                to err on the side of having more. That's good for our families. In addition to
                that, Wolf, there is a big problem. It's called encryption. And the people in San
                Bernardino were communicating with people who the FBI had been watching. But because
                their phone was encrypted, because the intelligence officials could not see who they
                were talking to, it was lost. We have to solve the encryption problem. It is not
                easy. A president of the United States, again, has to bring people together, have a
                position. We need to be able to penetrate these people when they are involved in
                these plots and these plans. And we have to give the local authorities the ability
                to penetrate to disrupt. That's what we need to do. Encryption is a major problem,

         </a> What it means is using overwhelming air power to utterly and
                completely destroy ISIS. To put things in perspective, in the first Persian Gulf
                War, we launched roughly 1,100 air attacks a day. We carpet bombed them for 36 days,
                saturation bombing, after which our troops went in and in a day and a half mopped up
                what was left of the Iraqi army. Right now, Obama is launching between 15 and 30 air
                attacks a day. It is photo op foreign policy. We need to use overwhelming air power.
                We need to be arming the Kurds. We need to be fighting and killing ISIS where they
                are. And let me go back to the earlier discussion a minute ago. It's not a lack of
                competence that is preventing the Obama administration from stopping these attacks.
                It is political correctness. We didn't monitor the Facebook posting of the female
                San Bernardino terrorist because the Obama DHS thought it would be inappropriate.
                She made a public call to jihad, and they didn't target it. The Tsarnaev brothers,
                the elder brother made a public call to jihad and the Obama administration didn't
                target it. Nidal Hasan communicated with Anwar al-Awlaki, a known radical cleric,
                asked about waging jihad against his fellow soldiers. The problem is because of
                political correctness, the Obama administration, like a lot of folks here, want to
                search everyone's cell phones and e-mails and not focus on the bad guys. And
                political correctness is killing people.</p>

                forces to direction the air power. But the object isn't to level a city. The object
                is to kill the ISIS terrorists. To make it — listen, ISIS is gaining strength
                because the perception is that they're winning. And President Obama fuels that
                perception. That will change when militants across the globe see that when you join
                ISIS that you are giving up your life, you are signing your death warrant, and we
                need a president who is focused on defeating every single ISIS terrorist and
                protecting the homeland, which should be the first priority.</p>

         </a> Thank you. Thank you, Senator. Senator Rubio, you've been
                critical of Senator Cruz's strategy. You say his voting record doesn't match his
                rhetoric. Why?</p>
            <p class="rubio" id="RUBIO7">
         <a href="#RUBIO8">
            <strong>RUBIO:</strong>
         </a> Well, let me begin by saying that we have to understand who
                ISIS is. ISIS is a radical Sunni group. They cannot just be defeated through air
                strikes. Air strikes are a key component of defeating them, but they must be
                defeated on the ground by a ground force. And that ground force must be primarily
                made up of Sunni Arabs themselves, Sunni Arabs that reject them ideologically and
                confront them militarily. We will have to embed additional American special
                operators alongside them to help them with training, to help them conduct special
                missions, and to help improve the air strikes. The air strikes are important, but we
                need to have an air force capable of it. And because of the budget cuts we are
                facing in this country, we are going to be left with the oldest and the smallest Air
                Force we have ever had. We have to reverse those cuts, in addition to the cuts to
                our Navy and in addition to the cuts to our Army, as well. And beyond that, I would
                say we must win the information war against ISIS. Every war we have ever been
                involved in has had a propaganda informational aspect to it. ISIS is winning the
                propaganda war. They are recruiting people, including Americans, to join them, with
                the promise that they are joining this great apocalyptic movement that is going to
                defeat the West. We have to show what life is really like in ISIS territory, and we
                have to show them why ISIS is not invincible, by going out and conducting these
                attacks and publicizing them to those who they recruit.</p>

         <a href="#BLITZER30">
            <strong>BLITZER:</strong>
         </a> Because I asked the question, Senator, because you said this.
                You said he, referring to Senator Cruz, voted against the Defense Authorization Act
                every year that it came up, and I assume that if he voted against it, he would veto
                it as president. That's the bill that funds our troops.</p>
            <p class="rubio" id="RUBIO8">
         <a href="#RUBIO9">
            <strong>RUBIO:</strong>
         </a> That is accurate. Three times he voted against the Defense
                Authorization Act, which is a bill that funds the troops. It also, by the way, funds
                the Iron Dome and other important programs. And I have to assume that if you vote
                against it in the Senate, you would also veto it as president. He has also
                supported, by the way, a budget that is called the containment budget. And it is a
                budget that would radically reduce the amount of money we spend on our military. You
                can't carpet bomb ISIS if you don't have planes and bombs to attack them with. And
                if we continue those cuts that we're doing now, not to mention additional cuts, we
                are going to be left with the oldest and the smallest Air Force this country has
                ever had, and that leaves us less safe.</p>

         </a> Well, you know, Marco has continued these attacks, and he knows
                they're not true. Yes, it is true that I voted against the National Defense
                Authorization Act, because when I campaigned in Texas I told voters in Texas that I
                would oppose the federal government having the authority to detain U.S. citizens

                somehow — he also has tossed more than a few insults this direction — let's be
                absolutely clear. ISIS and radical Islamic terrorism will face no more determined
                foe than I will be. We will utterly destroy them by targeting the bad guys. And one
                of the problems with Marco's foreign policy is he has far too often supported
                Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama undermining governments in the Middle East that
                have helped radical Islamic terrorists. We need to focus on killing the bad guys,

            <strong>RUBIO:</strong>
         </a> Yes, let me — three points of distinction. The first is, if
                you're an American citizen and you decide to join up with ISIS, we're not going to
                read you your Miranda rights. You're going to be treated as an enemy combatant, a
                member of an army attacking this country. [applause] Number two, we do need our
                defense capabilities. It is a fact that the cuts we are facing today and the cuts
                that Senator Cruz would have supported would leave us with an even smaller Air Force
                and a smaller Navy than the one we are going to be left with. And the final point
                that I would make is Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama's strategy is to lead from
                behind. It sounds like what he is outlining is not to lead at all. We cannot
                continue to outsource foreign policy. We must lead. We are the most powerful nation
                in the world. We need to begin to act like it, again. [applause]</p>

                JACOB, COLLEGE STUDENT: I'm Josh Jacob from Georgia Tech. Recently Donald Trump
                mentioned we must kill the families of ISIS members. However, this violates the
                principle of distinction between civilians and combatants in international law. So
                my question is, how would intentionally killing innocent civilians set us apart from
                ISIS? [end video]</p>

         </a> We have to be much tougher. We have to be much stronger than
                we've been. We have people that know what is going on. You take a look at just the
                attack in California the other day. There were numerous people, including the
                mother, that knew what was going on. They saw a pipe bomb sitting all over the
                floor. They saw ammunition all over the place. They knew exactly what was going on.
                When you had the World Trade Center go, people were put into planes that were
                friends, family, girlfriends, and they were put into planes and they were sent back,
                for the most part, to Saudi Arabia. They knew what was going on. They went home and
                they wanted to watch their boyfriends on television. I would be very, very firm with
                families. Frankly, that will make people think because they may not care much about
                their lives, but they do care, believe it or not, about their families' lives.

                Leadership, leadership is not about attacking people and disparaging people.
                Leadership is about creating a serious strategy to deal with the threat of our time.
                And I laid out that strategy before the attacks in Paris and before the attacks in
                San Bernardino. And it is the way forward. We need to increase our military
                spending. We need to deal with a no- fly zone in Syria, a safe zone. We need to
                focus on building a military that is second-to-none...</p>

                grow. I think those who have wanted regime change have made a mistake. When we
                toppled Gadhafi in Libya, I think that was a mistake. I think ISIS grew stronger, we

                another question, which is, is Donald Trump a serious candidate? The reason I ask
                this is, if you're going to close the Internet, realize, America, what that entails.
                That entails getting rid of the First amendment, OK? It's no small feat. If you are
                going to kill the families of terrorists, realize that there's something called the
                Geneva Convention we're going to have to pull out of. It would defy every norm that
                is America. So when you ask yourself, whoever you are, that think you're going to

                coming to our Foreign Relations Committee and saying, "Oh, we need to arm the allies
                of Al Qaida." They are still saying this. It is a crazy notion. This is the biggest

                strategy, you say the only way to defeat ISIS is with ground forces made up
                primarily of Sunni-Arab forces. Those Arab nations, though, as you well know,
                they've conducted less than five percent of the airstrikes and actually none since
                August. What makes you think they are willing to fight on the ground if they're not
                even willing to fight from the air?</p>

         <a href="#RUBIO11">
            <strong>RUBIO:</strong>
         </a> Well, they most certainly will have to be worked on to provide
                more than what they are doing now. There's no doubt about it. And there's one — one
                major reason why they have not been willing to be a broader part of the coalition,
                and that is they have lost complete trust and confidence in this president. This
                president cut a deal with their moral enemy, the Shia, in Iran. And this is the
                reason why they no longer trust this president and are willing to work alongside
                them. But they have as much invested in this as we do. In fact, more so, for it is
                the king of Saudi Arabia they want to behead first. It's the king of Jordan that
                they want to dethrone. It's the — they want to go into Egypt the way they've already
                gone into Libya. And on another point that we need to talk about, Assad is one of
                the main reasons why ISIS even exists to begin with. Assad is a puppet of Iran. And
                he has been so brutal toward the Sunni within Syria that he created the space that
                led to the people of Syria themselves to stand up and try to overthrow him. That led
                to the chaos which allowed ISIS to come in and take advantage of that situation and
                grow more powerful. And the fact that this president led from behind meant there
                were no alternative groups on the ground to be empowered, leaving ISIS with the
                prime operating space they needed to become the force they have now become.

         </a> Well, first I'll just point out that talking tough is not the
                same as being strong. And to wage war, we need a commander in chief who has made
                tough calls in tough times and stood up to be held accountable over and over, not
                first-term senators who've never made an executive decision in their life. One of
                the things I would immediately do, in addition to defeating them here at home, is
                bring back the warrior class — Petraeus, McChrystal, Mattis, Keane, Flynn. Every
                single one of these generals I know. Every one was retired early because they told
                President Obama things that he didn't want to hear. We must have Sunni-Arabs
                involved in this coalition. We must commit leadership, strength, support and
                resolve. I'll just add that Margaret Thatcher once said, "If you want something

                think that so many of these people have had so much to do in this national debate,
                they talk like they were bystanders. You know, we talk about our military being
                degraded over time, and yet we've had folks on this stage who've been a part of
                Congress who have participated in sequester; who participated in the degrading of
                this military over time. And that's why I think people get so frustrated with
                Washington, D.C. now. That's why they're so angry with the — the electorate is so
                angry with everybody who is involved in government in Washington, D.C. Because if
                you listen to the folks up here, you think that they weren't even there; they had
                nothing to do with this. This is a difference between being a governor and being in
                a legislature. See, because when something doesn't work in New Jersey, they look at
                me, say: "Why didn't it get done? Why didn't you do it?" You have to be responsible
                and accountable. And so on ISIS, let's be clear, the president needs to be a force
                that is trusted in the world. On this I agree with Marco. You know, this president
                is not trusted. If you're the King of Jordan, if you're a part of the royal family
                in Saudi Arabia and he's made this deal with Iran which gives them $150 billion to
                wage a war and try to extend their empire across the Middle East, why would you want
                to do it now? But I will tell you this, when I stand across from King Hussein of
                Jordan and I say to him, "You have a friend again sir, who will stand with you to
                fight this fight," he'll change his mind.</p>

         </a> First of all, I've been talking about this for over a year. We
                have to destroy their caliphate because that gives them legitimacy to go ahead with
                the global Jihad. We have to take their energy because they are — ISIS is the
                richest terrorist organization there is. We have to take their oil, shut down all of
                the mechanisms whereby they can disperse money because they go after disaffected
                individuals from all over the place, and they're able to pay them. That makes a
                difference. As far as the command centers are concerned in Raqqa and to a lesser
                degree Mosul, cut those off. Do the same kind of thing that we did with Sinjar a few
                weeks ago, working with our embedded special forces with the Kurds, shut off the
                supply route, soften them up, then we go in with specials ops followed by our air
                force to take them over. Those are things that work. But also, you know, this whole
                concept of boots on the ground, you know, we've got a phobia about boots on the
                ground. If our military experts say, we need boots on the ground, we should put
                boots on the ground and recognize that there will be boots on the ground and they'll
                be over here, and they'll be their boots if we don't get out of there now.</p>

                Clinton and Barack Obama led NATO in toppling the government in Libya. They did it
                because they wanted to promote democracy. A number of Republicans supported them.
                The result of that — and we were told then that there were these moderate rebels
                that would take over. Well, the result is, Libya is now a terrorist war zone run by
                jihadists. Move over to Egypt. Once again, the Obama administration, encouraged by
                Republicans, toppled Mubarak who had been a reliable ally of the United States, of
                Israel, and in its place, Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood came in, a terrorist
                organization. And we need to learn from history. These same leaders — Obama,
                Clinton, and far too many Republicans — want to topple Assad. Assad is a bad man.
                Gadhafi was a bad man. Mubarak had a terrible human rights record. But they were
                assisting us — at least Gadhafi and Mubarak — in fighting radical Islamic
                terrorists. And if we topple Assad, the result will be ISIS will take over Syria,
                and it will worsen U.S. national security interests. And the approach, instead of
                being a Woodrow Wilson democracy promoter...</p>

            <strong>RUBIO:</strong>
         </a> To begin with, Moammar Gadhafi and the revolt against Gadhafi
                was not started by the United States. It was started by the Libyan people. And the
                reason why I argued we needed to get involved is because he was going to go one way
                or the other. And my argument then was proven true, and that is, the longer that
                civil war took, the more militias would be formed and the more unstable the country
                would be after the fact. As far as Moammar Gadhafi is concerned, by the way, Moammar
                Gadhafi is the man that killed those Americans over Lockerbie, Scotland. Moammar
                Gadhafi is also the man that bombed that cafe in Berlin and killed those Marines.
                And you want to know why Moammar Gadhafi started cooperating on his nuclear program?
                Because we got rid of Saddam Hussein. And so he got scared that he would be next,
                and that's why he started cooperating. Look, we will have to work around the world
                with less than ideal governments. The government in Saudi Arabia is not a democracy,
                but we will have to work with them. The government in Jordan is not perfect, but we
                will have to work with them. But anti-American dictators like Assad, who help
                Hezbollah, who helped get those IEDs into Iraq, if they go, I will not shed a
                tear.</p>

                moderate rebels. It's like a purple unicorn. They never exist. These moderate rebels
                end up being jihadists. And I'll tell you whose view on Assad is the same as mine.
                It's Prime Minister Netanyahu. Prime Minister Netanyahu has said Israel doesn't have
                a dog in that fight because Assad is a puppet of Iran, a Shia radical Islamic
                terrorist, but at the same time, Prime Minister Netanyahu doesn't want to see Syria
                governed by ISIS. And we need to focus on American interests, not on global

                toppling Gadhafi then didn't listen to her own people on the ground. And then of
                course, when she lied about the terrorist attack in Benghazi, she invited more

                think because I think the regime change was a bad idea it means that Hussein was
                necessarily a good idea. There is often variations of evil on both sides of the war.
                What we have to decide is whether or not regime change is a good idea. It's what the
                neoconservatives have wanted. It's what the vast majority of those on the stage
                want. They still want regime change. They want it in Syria. They wanted it in Iraq.
                They want it in Libya. It has not worked. Out of regime change you get chaos. From
                the chaos you have seen repeatedly the rise of radical Islam. So we get this

                people killed. I think we are backing people we have no idea who they are. The
                rebels, we call them the rebels, the patriotic rebels. We have no idea. A lot of
                people think, Hugh, that they are ISIS. We have to do one thing at a time. We can't
                be fighting ISIS and fighting Assad. Assad is fighting ISIS. He is fighting ISIS.
                Russia is fighting now ISIS. And Iran is fighting ISIS. We have to do one thing at a
                time. We can't go — and I watched Lindsey Graham, he said, I have been here for 10
                years fighting. Well, he will be there with that thinking for another 50 years. He
                won't be able to solve the problem. We have to get rid of ISIS first. After we get
                rid of ISIS, we'll start thinking about it. But we can't be fighting Assad. And when
                you're fighting Assad, you are fighting Russia, you're fighting — you're fighting a
                lot of different groups. But we can't be fighting everybody at one time.</p>

         </a> Well, I think we have to focus, Hugh, on exactly what the
                priorities are. And to me, what I've always said is that the president has set up an
                awful situation through his deal with Iran, because what his deal with Iran has done
                is empower them and enrich them. And that's the way ISIS has been created and formed
                here. ISIS is created and formed because of the abuse that Assad and his Iranian
                sponsors have rained down on the Sunnis in Syria. And so when we empower Iran, this
                is why this president — and when Hillary Clinton says her theory against ISIS will
                be just about the same as the president, then get ready for more unrest and more
                murder and more violence in the Middle East. We need to focus our attention on Iran,
                because if you miss Iran, you are not going to get ISIS. The two are inextricably
                connected because one causes the other.</p>

         </a> No, I think it's a huge mistake. I think regime change in Syria,
                and this is what — I've been saying this for several years now. In 2013 when we
                first went in, I said, you are going to give arms to the allies of al Qaida, to
                radical jihadists? That's crazy. But the other thing I said is the great irony is
                you will be back fighting against your own weapons. Had Assad been bombed when he
                used chemical weapons two years ago, ISIS would be in charge of all of Syria now. We
                have to have a more realistic foreign policy and not a utopian one where we say, oh,
                we're going to spread freedom and democracy, and everybody in the Middle East is

                There's no way, if Saddam had not had weapons of mass destruction, I would have
                gone, because I don't believe that the U.S. should be involved directly in civil
                wars. I opposed the U.S. involvement in Lebanon. We ended up having to withdraw our
                marines after our barracks were blown up. There is a difference between Iraq, where
                you have Sunni, Shia, and Kurds put together after the First World War by the
                Western powers. It doesn't work. It needs to break up into three parts. And for the
                Russians, frankly, it's time that we punched the Russians in the nose. They've
                gotten away with too much in this world and we need to stand up against them, not

         </a> I didn't say I would cut off all communication with Putin.
                What I said was as president of the United States, now is not the time to talk with
                him. Reagan walked away at Reykjavik. There is a time and a place for everything.
                There is a time and a place for talk. And there is a time and a place for action. I
                know Vladimir Putin. He respects strength. He lied to our president's face; didn't
                both to tell him about warplanes and troops going into Syria. We need to speak to
                him from a position of strength. So as commander in chief, I will not speak to him
                until we've set up that no-fly zone; until we've gathered our Sunni-Arab allies and
                begun to deny ISIS territory; until I've called the supreme leader of Iran and told
                him new deal — new deal. We the United States of America are going to cut off the
                money flow, which we can do; which we don't need anyone's permission or
                collaboration to do. And I will not speak to him personally until we've rebuilt the
                6th Fleet a little bit right under his nose; rebuilt the missile defense program in
                Poland right under his nose; and conducted a few military exercises in the Baltic
                states. And let us remember one other thing. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are
                responsible for the growth of ISIS because they precipitously withdrew from Iraq in
                2011 against the advice of every single general and for political expediency. It's
                not these people up here. It's Hillary Clinton. [applause]</p>

         </a> Well, I think if you're in favor of World War III, you have your
                candidate. You know, here's...[applause]... the thing. My goodness, what we want in
                a leader is someone with judgment, not someone who is so reckless as to stand on the
                stage and say, "Yes, I'm jumping up and down; I'm going to shoot down Russian
                planes." Russia already flies in that airspace. It may not be something we're in
                love with the fact that they're there, but they were invited by Iraq and by Syria to
                fly in that airspace. And so if we announce we're going to have a no-fly zone, and
                others have said this. Hillary Clinton is also for it. It is a recipe for disaster.
                It's a recipe for World War III. We need to confront Russia from a position of
                strength, but we don't need to confront Russia from a point of recklessness that
                would lead to war. This is something — this type of judgment, you know, it's having
                that kind of judgment; who you would appoint and how you're going to conduct
                affairs, that is incredibly important. I mean, I think when we think about the
                judgment of someone who might want World War III, we might think about someone who
                might shut down a bridge because they don't like their friends; they don't want to —
                you know, they want to [inaudible] a Democrat. So I think we need to be very

         </a> Thank you, Dr. Carson. We've been talking tonight about programs
                and policy proposals that you all have to keep Americans safe and it's a big
                discussion on the campaign trail. Also about <span class="keyword">border</span>
                security and <em>immigration</em>. So let's talk about <em>immigration</em>. Senator Rubio. You co-authored a
                bill with Democrats two years ago that allowed a <span class="keyword">path to
                    citizenship</span> for undocumented immigrants. Do you still

                those immigrants rights,
                like the right to vote?</p>

            <p class="rubio" id="RUBIO12">
         <a href="#RUBIO13">
            <strong>RUBIO:</strong>
         </a> Yeah. <em> Immigration</em>
                    is not an issue that I read about in the newspaper or watch a documentary on PBS
                    or CNN. It's an issues I've lived around my whole life. My family are
                    immigrants. My wife's family are immigrants. All of my neighbors are immigrants.
                    I see every aspect of this problem. The good, the bad, and the ugly. And here's
                    what we learned in 2013. The American people don't trust the Federal Government
                    to enforce our immigration laws, and we will not be able to do anything on
                    immigration until we first prove to the American people that <em>illegal immigration</em>
                    is under control. And we can do that. We know what it takes to do
                    that. It takes at least 20,000 more additional <span class="keyword">border</span> agents. It takes completing those 700 miles of fencing. It
                takes a mandatory <span class="keyword">e-verify</span> system and a mandatory
                entry/exit tracking system to prevent overstays. After we have done that, the second
                thing we have to do is reform and modernize the legal <span class="keyword">immigration system</span>. And after we have done those two things, I
                    think the American people are gonna be reasonable with what do you do with
                    someone who has been in this country for 10 or 12 years who hasn't otherwise
                    violated our laws — because if they're a criminal they can't stay. They'll have
                    to undergo a background check, pay a fine, start paying taxes. And ultimately,
                    they'll given a work permit and that's all they're gonna be allowed to have for
                    at least 10 years. But you can't get to that third step until you have
                done the other two things, and that was the lesson we learned in 2013. There is no
                trust that the Federal Government will enforce the law. They will not support you
                until you see it done first.</p>

                where all they have is a permit, I personally am open to allowing people to apply
                for a green card. That may not be a majority position in my party, but that's down
                the road. You can't even begin that process until you prove to people — not just
                pass a law that says you're gonna bring <em>illegal immigration</em> under control.
                You're gonna have to do it and prove to people that it's working. And that was the
                lesson of 2013. And it's more true today, than it was then. After a migratory crisis
                on the <span class="keyword">border</span> with minors coming over that you're

         </a> Well, he — he has attempted to muddy the waters, but I think
                that anyone who watched the battle that we had. You know, there was a time for
                choosing as Reagan put it. Where there was a battle over <span class="keyword">amnesty</span> and some chose, like Senator Rubio to stand with Barack Obama
                and Chuck Schumer and support a massive <span class="keyword">amnesty</span>
                plan. Others chose to stand with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and the American
                people and secure the <span class="keyword">border</span>. And let me mention,
                this issue is actually directly connected to what we've been talking about. Because the front line with
                    ISIS isn't just in Iraq and Syria, it's in Kennedy Airport and the Rio Grande.
                    Border security is national security. And, you know, one of the most
                troubling aspects of the Rubio-Schumer Gang of Eight Bill was that it gave President
                Obama blanket authority to admit refugees, including Syrian refugees without mandating any
                background checks whatsoever. Now we've seen what happened in San Bernardino. When you are
                    letting people in, when the FBI can't vet them, it puts American citizens at
                    risk.
                 And I tell you, if I'm
                    elected president, we will secure the border. We will triple the border patrol.
                    We will build a wall that works and I'll get Donald Trump to pay for
                    it. [applause]</p>

         </a> Yeah, a couple points. In 2013 we had never faced a crisis like
                the Syrian refugee
                crisis now. Up until that point, a refugee meant someone fleeing oppression, fleeing Communism like it
                is in my community. As far as Ted's record, I'm always puzzled by his attack on this
                issue. Ted, you support legalizing people who are in this country illegally. Ted
                Cruz supported a 500-percent increase in the number of H-1 visas, the guest workers that are allowed
                into this country, and Ted supports doubling the number of green cards. So I think
                what's important for us to understand and there is a way forward on this issue that
                we can bring our country together on. And while I'm president I will do it. And it
                will begin by bringing <em>illegal immigration</em> under control and proving to the American

                plan on my website, tedcruz.org. It's 11 pages of existing federal law and in
                particular the question of what to do with people who are here now? You enforce the
                law. That means you stop the Obama administration's policy of releasing criminal
                    illegal aliens. Do
                you know how many aliens Bill
                Clinton deported? 12 million. Do you know how many illegal aliens, George W. Bush deported? 10
                    million. We can enforce
                    the laws and if we secure the border, that solves the problem. And as president I will solve

                    law enforcement for the threat against terror as well as for <em>immigration</em>. This is a
                    serious challenge and if we can get it right, yes, we'll start winning votes
                    again. The real problem isn't anybody on this stage, the real problem is
                Barack Obama has had six years to advocate a position to fix this and he's done
                nothing. The congress has funded these programs of building more <span class="keyword">fencing</span> and doing all this and he hasn't done it. He wants

         </a> Governor, thank you very much. So, Dr. Carson, you recently
                visited a refugee camp in Jordan and you deemed it your words, "really quite nice."
                Saying the people there didn't want to come to the United States. Do you think these

            <strong>CARSON:</strong>
         </a> Well, it was very interesting having an opportunity to talk to
                the Syrians themselves. And I asked them: What do you want? What is your supreme
                desire? Their supreme desire was to be settled back in their own country. I said,
                "What can Americans and other countries do?" They said, "Support the efforts of
                those who are trying to provide safety for us, including the Jordanians." Of course,
                they had a brand new hospital, for instance, that was unstaffed because there wasn't
                enough money to do it. But here's what's really neat. If you go into Hasakah
                province in northeast Syria, that's an area that's as big as Lebanon. It's
                controlled by the Kurds, the Christians and the moderate Sunnis. And there are
                airstrips and hotels. You could settle a lot of people there. All we would have to
                do is be willing to provide them with some weaponry, some defensive weaponry. And we
                seem to be afraid to give the Kurds weaponry. We like to send it for some strange
                reason through Baghdad, and then they only get a tenth of it. And if we would
                support them, we'd have a perfect ideal there. We don't need to set this up as we
                either take a bunch of <span class="keyword">refugees</span> who will be
                infiltrated with terrorists, I guarantee you. For them not to be would be terrorist
                malpractice. And we need to — to choose the right choice, not these false

            <strong>PAUL:</strong>
         </a> You know, I think we need to set the record straight on this,
                because I think Marco misspoke about the bill. On the Gang of Eight bill, there was no
                    provisions really for extra scrutiny or safety for refugees. At the time the bill came up, two
                        Iraqi refugees
                    came to my home town, Bowling Green, Kentucky. Their fingerprints were on a bomb
                    from Iraq. They were in the database, but we didn't pick them up.
                We relocated them here, put
                    them in government housing, got them on food stamps. And we began providing for
                    them, but we didn't have adequate security. On the Gang of Eight
                bill, on Marco's bill, we had an opportunity. There was a conservative consensus for
                an amendment I put forward called Trust, But Verify that would have strengthened
                border security on both refugees, students and those coming here. And Marco sided
                and I guess was more sympathetic to Chuck Schumer and to the president than he was
                to conservative principles. But this goes directly to national defense. And if he
                wants to run as a national — national defense conservative, he's got to explain why
                he hasn't stepped up to support <span class="keyword">border</span>

         </a> Well, he's just admitted — as he's just admitted, the reason
                why those refugees were
                allowed in was because they messed up in how they used the actual database. They
                should have known. They didn't because they didn't run the actual law as it exists
                now. It didn't work well.
                    As far as the refugees
                    are concerned, it's not that America doesn't want to accept refugees, Wolf. It's
                    that we may not be able to, because this is an issue we have to be 100 percent
                    right on. If we allow 9,999 Syrian refugees into the United States, and all of
                    them are good people, but we allow one person in who's an ISIS killer — we just
                    get one person wrong, we've got a serious problem. And there is not a
                single person in the national defense apparatus of this country that can guarantee
                you are going to be 100 percent right. And that's why as president, I'll take this very

                of the United States is to protect your safety and your security and the security
                and safety of your family. And this debate stops with me in the discussions with the
                FBI director. Now, listen,
                    I'm a former federal prosecutor, I know Jim Comey. We've worked together. He was
                    the U.S. attorney in Manhattan when I was a U.S. attorney in New Jersey. And
                    when Jim Comey gets up before Congress and says, we cannot effectively vet these
                    people, for me as president, that's the end of the conversation. We have to put
                    America's security first. [applause] The American people — we on this
                stage need to open our ears. We need to open our ears. The American people are not
                whispering to us. They are screaming to us. And they're screaming to us that it's
                our job to actually make this government work. It's so dysfunctional under Barack
                Obama and Hillary Clinton. It's so ineffective. It's so ineffectual that the
                American people say, we don't trust them to do anything anymore. So I'm not going to
                let Syrian refugees,
                any Syrian refugees in
                this country. And it was widows and orphans, by the way, and we now know from
                watching the San Bernardino attack that women can commit heinous, heinous acts
                against humanity just the same as men can do it. And so I don't back away from that
                position for a minute. When the FBI director tells me that he can vet those people,
                then we'll consider it and not a moment before because your safety and security is
                what's most important to me. [applause]</p>

                have an obligation to keep the 11.5 million people in Ohio safe. And we have been
                very effective with our Joint Terrorism Task Force, being able to make busts. In
                fact, we just made one three-four weeks ago against a person who was favorable to
                ISIS living in Akron. But let me tell you what is interesting about the
                administration. We had Central American miners that were placed in Ohio, and we

                now that some of them, there is a case going on where some of them may have been
                human-trafficked. So when the administration tells me we have a great vetting
                process, the proof is in the pudding. They sent these miners to us. Our schools were
                disrupted. We didn't know where they were. And bad things happened to them. And now
                they tell me that we ought to be able to admit these Syrian refugees. So, Wolf, look, people have
                accused me at times of having too big of a heart. You know, that's OK. But I have to
                also to say I must keep the people of my state safe. So we take a pause.</p>

                have to do if we want China's support is to push back on China. They, too, recognize
                one thing — strength and their own economic interest. I have done business in China
                for 25 years, so I know that in order to get China to cooperate with us, we must
                first actually retaliate against their cyber-attacks so they know we're serious. We
                have to push back on their desire to control the trade route through the South China
                Sea through which flows $5 trillion worth of goods and services every year. We
                cannot let them control the disputed islands, and we must work with the Australians,
                the South Koreans, the Japanese and the Filipinos to contain China. And then we must
                ask for their support and their help with North Korea. Because believe it or not,
                China is as concerned about Kim Jong-Un as we are.</p>

         </a> Well, I definitely believe that he is unstable, and I do, in
                fact, believe that China has a lot more influence with him than we do. But we also
                recognize that North Korea is in severe financial straits, and they have decided to
                use their resources to build their military, rather than to feed their people and to
                take care of the various humanitarian responsibilities that they have. We can
                capitalize upon that. You know, we should use our economic power in lots of
                different ways. I think we can use that in order to keep Putin contained, because he
                is a one-horse show. Energy. And we have an abundance of energy, but we have archaic
                energy exportation rules. We need to get rid of those, allow ourselves to really
                make Europe dependent on us and other parts of the world dependent on us for energy.
                Put him back in his little box where he belongs. And, you know, we need to be doing
                lots of other things with the resources that we have. So economic power works just
                as well as military power, perhaps even better. And speaking of that, our Military
                needs to be upgraded. You know, you look at things like our Ohio Class submarines,
                they're 25 years old. Our minuteman 3 missiles — they are 34 years old. Our B-52
                bombers — 50 years old. You know, if we don't get the military right nothing else
                matters.</p>

                against the U.S. on your watch, "they're going to see cyber- warfare like they have
                never seen before." What exactly would that response look like?</p>

         <a href="#CHRISTIE9">
            <strong>CHRISTIE:</strong>
         </a> Well, what it would like is, we have one of the great
                advantages of America being the open society that we are. It is, we are not hiding
                things from the American people, but China everyday is conducting business in a way
                that hides things from their people. So if they want to come in and attack all the
                personnel records in the federal government, which they've done, and which — they
                now have my Social Security number and my fingerprints, as well as maybe some other
                folks' who are on this stage. The fact is, they need to be fought back on. And what
                we need to do is go at the things that they are most sensitive and most embarrassing
                to them; that they're hiding; get that information and put it out in public. Let the
                Chinese people start to digest how corrupt the Chinese government is; how they steal
                from the Chinese people; and how they're enriching oligarchs all throughout China.
                They need to understand that. And we need to take those type of steps. This
                president has seen personnel records of people who have sacrificed for the American
                people and for the federal government stolen by the Chinese and he's done nothing in
                return. This is why — this is what I said at the beginning that this administration,
                Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton through their foreign policy, have betrayed the
                American people, because the weakness they've displayed has led to Putin's
                incursions in the Middle East and in eastern Europe, and has led — has led to
                significant problems in the Middle East as well, and the death and murder of lots of
                folks.</p>

                you concerned that that could really escalate with China, that they would retaliate?
                And, for example, as the NSA has said, attack the U.S. and maybe it's power grid,

            <strong>BUSH:</strong>
         </a> I completely agree with Chris. And this administration has been
                so lax. Think about it. Hillary Clinton is using a private server for — where
                classified information go by. This is a — this is a serious administration? The
                president receives an inspector general's report that the Office of Personnel
                Management could be hacked into; they had antiquated firewalls; 23 million files
                have been — are in the hands of the Chinese allegedly, including, by the way,
                members of the press, it turns out, last week. Maybe that's the only part that's
                good news, so that you guys can get a feel for what it's like now to see this type
                of attack. This is something — we have to have the best defensive capabilities. We
                need to coordinate all of our efforts with the private sector. We need to give them
                liability relief so that we can do that. And offensively, we need to have
                capabilities second to none. We need to create a situation where they know that
                there will be adverse impacts if they continue to do what they're doing. They'll
                respect that. They'll respect a United States that is serious about protecting our —
                our infrastructure. If we don't do it, we'll continue to see what's — exactly what's
                happening, not just from the Chinese, by the way. The Russians and rogue actors,
                including ISIS — this is a serious part of the 21st century security challenge that
                we face.</p>

         </a> Mr. Trump...[applause]... Dr. Carson just referenced the
                single most important job of the president, the command, the control and the care of
                our nuclear forces. And he mentioned the triad. The B-52s are older than I am. The
                missiles are old. The submarines are aging out. It's an executive order. It's a
                commander-in-chief decision. What's your priority among our nuclear triad?</p>

            <p class="trump" id="TRUMP35">
         <a href="#TRUMP36">
            <strong>TRUMP:</strong>
         </a> Well, first of all, I think we need somebody absolutely that we
                can trust, who is totally responsible; who really knows what he or she is doing.
                That is so powerful and so important. And one of the things that I'm frankly most
                proud of is that in 2003, 2004, I was totally against going into Iraq because you're
                going to destabilize the Middle East. I called it. I called it very strongly. And it
                was very important. But we have to be extremely vigilant and extremely careful when
                it comes to nuclear. Nuclear changes the whole ball game. Frankly, I would have said
                get out of Syria; get out — if we didn't have the power of weaponry today. The power
                is so massive that we can't just leave areas that 50 years ago or 75 years ago we
                wouldn't care. It was hand-to-hand combat. The biggest problem this world has today
                is not President Obama with global warming, which is inconceivable, this is what
                he's saying. The biggest problem we have is nuclear — nuclear proliferation and
                having some maniac, having some madman go out and get a nuclear weapon. That's in my
                opinion, that is the single biggest problem that our country faces right
                now.</p>

            <strong>RUBIO:</strong>
         </a> I do. First, let's explain to people at home who the triad —
                what the triad is. Maybe a lot of people haven't heard that terminology before. The
                triad is our ability of the United States to conduct nuclear attacks using
                airplanes, using missiles launched from silos or from the ground, and also from our
                nuclear subs' ability to attack. And it's important — all three of them are
                critical. It gives us the ability at deterrence. Now, some have become more critical
                than others; for example, the submarines. And that's the Ohio Class submarine that
                needs to be modernized. The air component also needs to be modernized. The B-52, as
                someone earlier pointed out, is an outdated model that was flown by the grandparents
                of people that are flying it now. And we need a serious modernization program as
                well on our silo-launched missiles. All three are critical for the defense of the
                country.</p>

                directed all of his...[crosstalk] I'm answering the question, Dana. He directed all
                of his forces to defeating communism. One of the things we've seen here is how easy
                it is for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton to get distracted from dealing with
                radical Islamic terrorism. They won't even call it by its name. We need a president
                who stands up, number one, and says, we will defeat ISIS. And number two, says the

         </a> I've gained great respect for the Republican leadership. I've
                gained great respect for many — and I'm going to even say — I mean, in different
                forms for the people on the dais, in different forms. [laughter] In different forms.
                But I have great respect for the people I have met through this process. I've never
                done this process before. I've never been a politician. I mean, for the last six
                months I've been a politician. But I will tell you, I am totally committed to the
                Republican Party. I feel very honored to be the front runner. [applause] And I think
                I'll do very well if I'm chosen. If I'm so fortunate to be chosen, I think I'll do
                very well. Polls have come out recently saying I would beat Hillary. I will do
                everything in my power to beat Hillary Clinton, I promise you. [applause]</p>

                have in the past with a lot of subterfuge and dishonesty, or like they're going act
                now because I spike to Reince Priebus, and he assured me that the Washington Post
                writer had it all wrong, and that they're not be engaging in anything to thwart the
                will of the people. That's why I got into this race, as a member of we the people,

            <p class="paul" id="PAUL15">
         <strong>PAUL:</strong> The greatest threat to our national security is our debt. We
                borrow a million dollars a minute. And whose fault is it? Well, frankly, it's both
                parties' fault. You have those on the right who clamor and say, oh, we will spend
                anything on the military, and those on the left who say the same for domestic
                welfare. But what most Americans don't realize is there is an unholy alliance. They
                come together. There's a secret handshake. We spend more money on everything. And we
                are not stronger nation if we go further into debt. We are not projecting power from
                bankruptcy court. To me, there is no greater threat than our debt. I'm the only
                fiscal conservative on the stage because I'm willing to hold the line on all
                spending. I hope you will consider me in the election. Thank you very much.

                Ohio are the people of America. The people of America are reflected in Ohio. Our
                message has to be big, and bold, and positive, and connect, not just with people's

         <strong>CHRISTIE:</strong> On September 10th, 2001, I was named chief federal
                prosecutor in New Jersey and on September 11th, 2001, my wife and my brother who are
                in the audience tonight went through the World Trade Center and to their offices
                just blocks away from the Trade Center. I lost touch with them for six hours that
                day and prayed that they were alive. Luckily, they were sent home. But many of our
                friends and others in our neighborhood lost their lives that day. Terrorism —
                radical jihadist terrorism is not theoretical to me. It's real. And for seven years,
                I spent my life protecting our country against another one of those attacks. You
                won't have to worry when I'm President of the Untied States whether that can be done
                because I've already done it. I want the chance to do it again to protect you, your

                countries where we thought corporate interests would be attacked next. To take our
                country back, to keep our nation safe, we have to begin by beating Hillary Clinton.
                We need to unify our party. We need to better than our government, which 75 percent
                of the American people now think is corrupt and incompetent. They're right. We need
                to better than our politics. 80 percent think we have a professional/political class

                actually on getting anything done. We need to unify our party, we need a real

         <strong>RUBIO:</strong> Thank you. As we near the end of this year, we enter one of the
                most important elections in a generation. For what's at stake in this election is
                not simply what party's going to be in charge. But our very identity as a people and
                as a nation. For over 200 years this has been a special country. A unique place
                where anyone from anywhere can achieve anything. But now millions of Americans feel
                like they're being left behind. Insecure in their future and unsafe in the face of
                terrorism. This election is about electing a president that will restore our
                economic vibrancy so that the American dream can expand to reach more people and
                change more lives than ever before. And rebuild our Military and our intelligence
                programs so that we can remain the strongest nation on earth. Tonight I ask you for
                your vote. If you do this, we will rebuild this country, and together we will usher
                in a new American century — the greatest era in the history of this great
                land.</p>

                win again and we will win again. Ronald Reagan reignited the American economy,
                rebuilt the Military, bankrupted the Soviet Union and defeated Soviet Communism. I
                will do the same thing. Cutting taxes, cutting regulation, unleashing small
                businesses and rebuilding the Military to defeat radical Islamic terrorism — our
                strategy is simple. We win, they lose. We've done it before and we can do it

                country that the world has ever known. And I want to make sure that we preserve that
                exceptionalism for the next generation. My mother told me if I work hard and I
                really believed in American principles and I believed in God, anything is possible.
                I believe that is true, and that's why I'm not anxious to give away American values
