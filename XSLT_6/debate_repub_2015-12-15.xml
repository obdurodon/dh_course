            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Welcome to the CNN-Facebook Republican presidential debate
                here at the Venetian Las Vegas. We have a very enthusiastic audience. Everyone is
                here. They're looking forward to a serious and spirited discussion about the
                security of this nation. I'm Wolf Blitzer, your moderator tonight. This debate is
                airing on CNN networks here in the United States and around the world, and on the
                Salem Radio Network. The nine leading candidates, they are here. Let's welcome them
                right now. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky. [applause] New Jersey Governor Chris
                Christie. [applause] Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. [applause] Senator Ted Cruz
                of Texas. [applause] Businessman and real estate developer Donald Trump. [applause]
                Retired neurosurgeon, Dr. Ben Carson. [applause] Senator Marco Rubio of Florida.
                [applause] Former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina. [applause] And Ohio Governor
                John Kasich. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome these Republican candidates for president
                of the United States. [applause] This is the final Republican debate before the
                election year begins, and we're taking a moment for the photographs of the
                candidates together on the stage. Now, everyone, please rise for the national anthem
                sung by Ayla Brown. [national anthem] [applause]</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> I know everyone is eager to get started. So, candidates,
                please take your places while I explain the ground rules for tonight. As moderator,
                I'll guide the discussion, and I'll be joined in the questioning by Salem Radio
                Network talk show host Hugh Hewitt and CNN's chief political correspondent Dana
                Bash. We also asked Republicans and independents nationwide to share their questions
                for the candidates. We teamed up with Facebook to send a campaign camper across the
                country over the past several weeks. Thousands of people stepped inside and recorded
                their questions on video. Millions more have weighed in on Facebook. Candidates,
                I'll try to make sure each of you gets your fair share of questions. You'll have a
                minute and 15 seconds to answer and 30 seconds for follow-ups and rebuttals. I'll
                give you time to respond if you're singled out for criticism. Our viewers should
                know that we have timing lights that are visible to the candidates to warn them when
                their time is up. And as the candidates requested, a bell will sound like this. We
                know you are all eager to jump in and debate these important issues, so, please,
                wait until you're called on. These nine Republicans are positioned on stage based on
                their ranking in the recent polls, so let's begin right now. I'd like to invite each
                candidate to introduce himself or herself to our audience. You'll have one minute.
                First to you, Senator Paul.</speech>
            <speech speaker="PAUL"> The question is, how do we keep America safe from terrorism?
                Trump says we ought to close that Internet thing. The question really is, what does
                he mean by that? Like they do in North Korea? Like they do in China? Rubio says we
                should collect all Americans' records all of the time. The Constitution says
                otherwise. I think they're both wrong. I think we defeat terrorism by showing them
                that we do not fear them. I think if we ban certain religions, if we censor the
                Internet, I think that at that point the terrorists will have won. Regime change
                hasn't won. Toppling secular dictators in the Middle East has only led to chaos and
                the rise of radical Islam. I think if we want to defeat terrorism, I think if we
                truly are sincere about defeating terrorism, we need to quit arming the allies of
                ISIS. If we want to defeat terrorism, the boots on the ground — the boots on the
                ground need to be Arab boots on the ground. As commander-in-chief, I will do
                whatever it takes to defend America. But in defending America, we cannot lose what
                America stands for. Today is the Bill of Rights' anniversary. I hope we will
                remember that and cherish that in the fight on terrorism.</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Thank you, Senator. [applause] Governor Kasich?</speech>
            <speech speaker="KASICH"> Thank you, Wolf. Just last weekend, just last week, a friend
                asked one of my daughters, "Do you like politics?" And my daughter said, "No, I
                don't. And the reason I don't like it is because there's too much fighting, too much
                yelling. It's so loud, I don't like it." You know, I turned to my friend and I said,
                "You know, she's really on to something." And when we think about our country and
                the big issues that we face in this country; creating jobs, making sure people can
                keep their jobs, the need for rising wages, whether our children when they graduate
                from college can find a job, protecting the homeland, destroying ISIS, rebuilding
                defense. These are all the things that we need to focus on but we'll never get there
                if we're divided. We'll never get there if republicans and democrats just fight with
                one another. Frankly, we are republicans and they're democrats but before all of
                that, we're Americans. And I believe we need to unify in so many ways to rebuild our
                country, to strengthen our country, to rebuild our defense, and for America to
                secure it's place it world; for us, for our children, and for the next generation.
                Thank you. [applause]</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Governor Christie?</speech>
            <speech speaker="CHRISTIE"> Thank you Wolf. America has been betrayed. We've been
                betrayed by the leadership that Barack Obama and Hilary Clinton have provided to
                this country over the last number of years. Think about just what's happened today.
                The second largest school district in America in Los Angeles closed based on a
                threat. Think about the effect that, that's going to have on those children when
                they go back to school tomorrow wondering filled with anxiety to whether they're
                really going to be safe. Think about the mothers who will take those children
                tomorrow morning to the bus stop wondering whether their children will arrive back
                on that bus safe and sound. Think about the fathers of Los Angeles, who tomorrow
                will head off to work and wonder about the safety of their wives and their children.
                What is Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton done to this country? That the most basic
                responsibility of an administration is to protect the safety and security of the
                American people. I will tell you this, I'm a former federal prosecutor, I've fought
                terrorists and won and when we get back in the White House we will fight terrorists
                and win again and America will be safe. [applause]</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Ms. Fiorina?</speech>
            <speech speaker="FIORINA"> Like all of you I'm angry. I'm angry at what's happening to
                our nation. Citizens, it's time to take our country back. Bombastic insults wont
                take it back. Political rhetoric that promises a lot and delivers little, won't take
                it back. All of our problems can be solved. All of our wounds can be healed by a
                tested leader who is willing to fight for the character of our nation. I have been
                tested. I have beaten breast cancer. I have buried a child. I started as a
                secretary. I fought my way to the top of corporate America while being called every
                B word in the book. I fought my way into this election and on to this debate stage
                while all the political insiders and the pundits told, "it couldn't be done." I've
                been told, "no,: all my life. And all my life, I've refused to accept no as an
                answer. Citizens, it is time to take our country back from the political class, from
                the media, from the liberal elite. It can be done, it must be done, join me and we
                will get it done. [applause]</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Governor Bush?</speech>
            <speech speaker="BUSH"> Our freedom is under attack. Our economy is under water. The
                leading democrat is under investigation. And America is under the gun to lead the
                free world to protect our civilized way of life. Serious times require strong
                leadership, that's what at stake right now. Regarding national security, we need to
                restore the defense cuts of Barack Obama to rebuild our military, to destroy ISIS
                before it destroys us. Regarding economic security, we need to take power and money
                away from Washington D.C. and empower American families so that they can rise up
                again. Look, America still is an exceptional country. We love to lead and we love to
                win. And we do it, when we take on any challenge and when we take – we support our
                friends. As president, I will keep you and our country safe, secure, and free. Thank
                you.</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Senator Rubio?</speech>
            <speech speaker="RUBIO"> Thank you Wolf. It's really amazing to be back in Las Vegas. I
                spent six years as a child growing not far from where we stand tonight. I use to sit
                on the porch of our home and listen to my grandfather tell stories as he smoked one
                of three daily cigars. One of the things my grandfather instilled in me, was that I
                was really blessed because I was a citizen of the greatest country in the history of
                our mankind. But there have always been people in American politics that wanted
                America to be more like the rest of the world. And In 2008, one of them was elected
                president of this country and the result has been a disaster. Today you have
                millions of Americans that feel left out and out of place in their own country,
                struggling to live paycheck to paycheck, called bigots because they hold on to
                traditional values. And around the world, America's influence has declined while
                this president has destroyed our military, our allies no longer trust us, and our
                adversaries no longer respect us. And that is why this election is so important.
                That is why I'm running for president. And that's why I'm going to ask you for your
                vote tonight. If you elect me president, we will have a president that believes
                America is the greatest country in the world and we will have a president that acts
                like it. [applause]</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Senator Cruz.</speech>
            <speech speaker="CRUZ"> Thank you, Wolf. America is at war. Our enemy is not violent
                extremism. It is not some unnamed malevolent force. It is radical Islamic terrorist.
                We have a president who is unwilling to utter its name. The men and women on this
                stage, every one of us, is better prepared to keep this nation safe than is Barack
                Obama or Hillary Clinton. We need a president who understands the first obligation
                of the commander-in-chief is to keep America safe. If I am elected president, we
                will hunt down and kill the terrorists. We will utterly destroy ISIS. We will stop
                the terrorist attacks before they occur because we will not be prisoners to
                political correctness. Rather, we will speak the truth. Border security is national
                security and we will not be admitting jihadists as refugees. We will keep America
                safe. [applause]</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Dr. Carson.</speech>
            <speech speaker="CARSON"> Thank you, Wolf. Please join me for a moment of silence and
                remembrance of the San Bernardino victims. Thank you. You know, our country since
                its inception has been at war, every 15 or 20 years. But the war that we are
                fighting now against radical Islamist jihadists is one that we must win. Our very
                existence is dependent upon that. You know, as a pediatric neurosurgeon, I
                frequently faced life and death situations, and had to come up with the right
                diagnosis, the right plan, and execute that plan frequently with other colleagues.
                Right now, the United States of America is the patient. And the patient is in
                critical condition and will not be cured by political correctness and will not be
                cured by timidity. And I am asking the Congress, which represents the people, to
                declare a war on ISIS so that we can begin the process of excising that cancer and
                begin the healing process, and bring peace, prosperity, and safety back to America.
                [applause]</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Mr. Trump.</speech>
            <speech speaker="TRUMP"> Thank you. I began this journey six months ago. My total focus
                was on building up our military, building up our strength, building up our borders,
                making sure that China, Japan, Mexico, both at the border and in trade, no longer
                takes advantage of our country. Certainly would never have made that horrible,
                disgusting, absolutely incompetent deal with Iran where they get $150 billion.
                They're a terrorist nation. But I began it talking about other things. And those
                things are things that I'm very good at and maybe that's why I'm center stage.
                People saw it. People liked it. People respected it. A month ago things changed.
                Radical Islamic terrorism came into effect even more so than it has been in the
                past. People like what I say. People respect what I say. And we've opened up a very
                big discussion that needed to be opened up. Thank you very much. [applause]</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Thank you. Since you last debated, Americans have witnessed
                terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino. The FBI director says the country now
                faces the greatest terror threat since 9/11. You all have different approaches to
                keeping the country safe. And that will be the focus of tonight's debate. Mr. Trump,
                as you mentioned in your opening statement, part of your strategy is to focus in on
                America's borders. To keep the country safe, you say you want to temporarily ban
                non-American Muslims from coming to the United States; ban refugees fleeing ISIS
                from coming here; deport 11 million people; and wall off America's southern border.
                Is the best way to make America great again to isolate it from much of the rest of
                the world?</speech>
            <speech speaker="TRUMP"> We are not talking about isolation. We're talking about
                security. We're not talking about religion. We're talking about security. Our
                country is out of control. People are pouring across the southern border. I will
                build a wall. It will be a great wall. People will not come in unless they come in
                legally. Drugs will not pour through that wall. As far as other people like in the
                migration, where they're going, tens of thousands of people having cell phones with
                ISIS flags on them? I don't think so, Wolf. They're not coming to this country. And
                if I'm president and if Obama has brought some to this country, they are leaving.
                They're going. They're gone. [applause]</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Governor Bush, you called Mr. Trump "unhinged" when he
                proposed banning non-American Muslims from the United States. Why is that
                unhinged?</speech>
            <speech speaker="BUSH"> Well, first of all, we need to destroy ISIS in the caliphate.
                That's — that should be our objective. The refugee issue will be solved if we
                destroy ISIS there, which means we need to have a no-fly zone, safe zones there for
                refugees and to build a military force. We need to embed our forces — our troops
                inside the Iraqi military. We need to arm directly the Kurds. And all of that has to
                be done in concert with the Arab nations. And if we're going to ban all Muslims, how
                are we going to get them to be part of a coalition to destroy ISIS? The Kurds are
                the greatest fighting force and our strongest allies. They're Muslim. Look, this is
                not a serious proposal. In fact, it will push the Muslim world, the Arab world away
                from us at a time when we need to reengage with them to be able to create a strategy
                to destroy ISIS. So Donald, you know, is great at — at the one-liners, but he's a
                chaos candidate. And he'd be a chaos president. He would not be the commander in
                chief we need to keep our country safe. [applause]</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Mr. Trump?</speech>
            <speech speaker="TRUMP"> Jeb doesn't really believe I'm unhinged. He said that very
                simply because he has failed in this campaign. It's been a total disaster. Nobody
                cares. And frankly, I'm the most solid person up here. I built a tremendous company
                and all I want to do is make America great again. I don't want our country to be
                taken away from us, and that's what's happening. The policies that we've suffered
                under other presidents have been a disaster for our country. We want to make America
                great again. And Jeb, in all fairness, he doesn't believe that.</speech>
            <speech speaker="BUSH"> Look, he mentioned me. I can bring — I can talk. This is — this
                is the problem. Banning all Muslims will make it harder for us to do exactly what we
                need to do, which is to destroy ISIS. We need a strategy. We need to get the lawyers
                off the back of the warfighters. Right now under President Obama, we've created this
                — this standard that is so high that it's impossible to be successful in fighting
                ISIS. We need to engage with the Arab world to make this happen. It is not a serious
                proposal to say that — to the people that you're asking for their support that they
                can't even come to the country to even engage in a dialogue with us. That's not a
                serious proposal. We need a serious leader to deal with this. And I believe I'm that
                guy. [applause]</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Senator Rubio — I'm going to go to Senator Rubio and get his
                thoughts. You have said banning Muslims is unconstitutional. But according to a
                recent ABC News-Washington Post poll, a majority of Republicans support Mr. Trump's
                idea. Why are they wrong?</speech>
            <speech speaker="RUBIO"> Well, I understand why they feel that way, because this
                president hasn't kept us safe. The problem is we had an attack in San Bernardino.
                And we were paying attention to the most important issue we have faced in a decade
                since 9/11, and then all the talk was about this proposal, which isn't going to
                happen. But this is what's important to do is we must deal frontally with this
                threat of radical Islamists, especially from ISIS. This is the most sophisticated
                terror group that has ever threatened the world or the United States of America.
                They are actively recruiting Americans. The attacker in San Bernardino was an
                American citizen, born and raised in this country. He was a health inspector; had a
                newborn child and left all that behind to kill 14 people. We also understand that
                this is a group that's growing in its governance of territory. It's not just Iraq
                and Syria. They are now a predominant group in Libya. They are beginning to pop up
                in Afghanistan. They are increasingly involved now in attacks in Yemen. They have
                Jordan in their sights. This group needs to be confronted with serious proposals.
                And this is a very significant threat we face. And the president has left us unsafe.
                He spoke the other night to the American people to reassure us. I wish he hadn't
                spoken at all. He made things worse. Because what he basically said was we are going
                to keep doing what we're doing now, and what we are doing now is not working.

            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Hugh Hewitt, you have a question.</speech>
            <speech speaker="HEWITT"> Senator Cruz, you've said you disagree with Mr. Trump's
                policy. I don't want a cage match; you've tweeted you don't want a cage match. But
                Republican primary voters deserve to know, with the kind of specificity and
                responsiveness you delivered in your nine Supreme Court arguments, how you disagree
                with Mr. Trump. Would you spell that out with us?</speech>
            <speech speaker="CRUZ"> Well, listen, Hugh, everyone understands why Donald has
                suggested what he has. We're looking at a president who's engaged in this
                double-speak where he doesn't call radical Islamic terrorism by its name. Indeed, he
                gives a speech after the San Bernardino attack where his approach is to try to go
                after the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens rather than to keep us safe.
                And even worse, President Obama and Hillary Clinton are proposing bringing tens of
                thousands of Syrian refugees to this country when the head of the FBI has told
                Congress they cannot vet those refugees. I understand why Donald made that proposal.
                I introduced legislation in the Senate that I believe is more narrowly focused at
                the actual threat, which is radical Islamic terrorism, and what my legislation would
                do is suspend all refugees for three years from countries where ISIS or Al Qaida
                control substantial territory.</speech>
            <speech speaker="HEWITT"> So you're saying you disagree because he's too broad and you
                have a narrower focus? Why do you disagree with him?</speech>
            <speech speaker="CRUZ"> Well, you know, I'm reminded of what FDR's grandfather said. He
                said, "All horse-thieves are Democrats, but not all Democrats are horse-thieves."
                [laughter] In this instance, there are millions of peaceful Muslims across the
                world, in countries like India, where there is not the problems we are seeing in
                nations that are controlled — have territory controlled by Al Qaida or ISIS, and we
                should direct at the problem, focus on the problem, and defeat radical Islamic
                terrorism. It's not a war on a faith; it's a war on a political and theocratic
                ideology that seeks to murder us.</speech>
            <speech speaker="HEWITT"> Carly Fiorina... [applause] ... this is the Christmas dinner
                debate. This will be the debate that Americans talk about at Christmas. And thus
                far, in the first 10 minutes, we haven't heard a lot about Ronald Reagan's city on a
                hill. We've heard a lot about keeping Americans out or keeping Americans safe and
                everyone else out. Is this what you want the party to stand for?</speech>
            <speech speaker="FIORINA"> What I think we need to stand for are solutions. I offer
                myself as a leader to the people of this country because I think they're looking for
                solutions, not lawyers arguing over laws or entertainers throwing out sound bites
                that draw media attention. We need to solve the problem. To solve the problem, we
                need to do something here at home and something over there in their caliphate. We
                need to deny them territory. But here at home, we need to do two fundamental things.
                Number one, we need to recognize that technology has moved on. The Patriot Act was
                signed in 2001, roughly. The iPhone was invented in 2007. The iPad was invented in
                2011. Snapchat and Twitter, all the rest of it, have been around just for several
                years. Technology has moved on, and the terrorists have moved on with it. Let me
                tell you a story. Soon after 9/11, I got a phone call from the NSA. They needed
                help. I gave them help. I stopped a truckload of equipment. I had it turned around.
                It was escorted by the NSA into headquarters. We need the private sector's help,
                because government is not innovating. Technology is running ahead by leaps and
                bound. The private sector will help, just as I helped after 9/11. But they must be
                engaged, and they must be asked. I will ask them. I know them. [applause]</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Governor Christie, Americans are clearly more afraid today
                than at any time since 9/11. As you mentioned in your opening statement, today in
                Los Angeles, 650 schoolchildren didn't go to — 650,000 schoolchildren didn't go to
                school because of an e-mail threat, this two weeks after an attack killed 14 people
                in San Bernardino. Is this the new normal? And if so, what steps would you take as
                president of the United States to ensure that fear does not paralyze
                America?</speech>
            <speech speaker="CHRISTIE"> Wolf, unfortunately, it's the new normal under Barack Obama
                and Hillary Clinton. The fact is that if you listen to Hillary Clinton the other
                day, what she said to the American people was, as regards to ISIS, my strategy would
                be just about the same as the president's. Just about the same as the president's?
                We have people across this country who are scared to death. Because I could tell you
                this, as a former federal prosecutor, if a center for the developmentally disabled
                in San Bernardino, California, is now a target for terrorists, that means everywhere
                in America is a target for these terrorists. Now, I spent seven years of my life in
                the immediate aftermath of September 11th doing this work, working with the Patriot
                Act, working with our law enforcement, working with the surveillance community to
                make sure that we keep America safe. What we need to do, Wolf, is restore those
                tools that have been taken away by the president and others, restore those tools to
                the NSA and to our entire surveillance and law enforcement community. We need a
                president who is going to understand what actionable intelligence looks like and act
                on it. And we need a president and a cabinet who understands that the first and most
                important priority of the president of the United States is to protect the safety
                and security of Americans. As someone who has done it, I will make sure it gets done
                again. [applause]</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Thank you. Governor Kasich, one of the killers in San
                Bernardino was an American who was not on anyone's watch list. How are you going to
                find that radicalized person and stop another such attack?</speech>
            <speech speaker="KASICH"> Well, first of all, Wolf, I said last February that we needed
                to have people on the ground, troops on the ground in a coalition similar to what we
                had in the first Gulf War. I remember when the Egyptian ambassador to the United
                States stood in the Rose Garden and pledged Arab commitment to removing Saddam
                Hussein from Kuwait. Before we came out here tonight, I am told that the Saudis have
                organized 34 countries who want to join in the battle against terrorism. First and
                foremost, we need to go and destroy ISIS. And we need to do this with our Arab
                friends and our friends in Europe. And when I see they have a climate conference
                over in Paris, they should have been talking about destroying ISIS because they are
                involved in virtually every country, you know, across this world. [applause] Now,
                you destroy ISIS in a coalition. You get joint intelligence with our European
                friends. And then here at home, there are things called the Joint Terrorism Task
                Force, headed by the FBI, and made up of local law enforcement, including state
                police. They need the tools. And the tools involve encryption where we cannot hear
                what they're even planning. And when we see red flags, a father, a mother, a
                neighbor who says we have got a problem here, then we have to give law enforcement
                the ability to listen so they can disrupt these terrorist attacks before they occur.
                We can do this, but we've got to get moving. Pay me now or pay me a lot more later.
                This is the direction we need to go. [applause]</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Thank you. Dana Bash, you have the next question.</speech>
            <speech speaker="BASH"> A crucial question is how to balance surveillance with privacy
                and keeping Americans safe. Senator Cruz, you voted for a bill that President Obama
                signed into law just this past June that made it harder for the government to access
                Americans' phone records. In light of the San Bernardino attack, was your vote a
                mistake?</speech>
            <speech speaker="CRUZ"> Well, Dana, the premise of your question is not accurate. I'm
                very proud to have joined with conservatives in both the Senate and the House to
                reform how we target bad guys. And what the USA Freedom Act did is it did two
                things. Number one, it ended the federal government's bulk collection of phone
                metadata of millions of law-abiding citizens. But number two in the second half of
                it that is critical. It strengthened the tools of national security and law
                enforcement to go after terrorists. It gave us greater tools and we are seeing those
                tools work right now in San Bernardino. And in particular, what it did is the prior
                program only covered a relatively narrow slice of phone calls. When you had a
                terrorist, you could only search a relatively narrow slice of numbers, primarily
                land lines. The USA Freedom Act expands that so now we have cell phones, now we have
                Internet phones, now we have the phones that terrorists are likely to use and the
                focus of law enforcement is on targeting the bad guys. You know what the Obama
                administration keeps getting wrong is whenever anything bad happens they focus on
                law-abiding citizens instead of focusing on the bad guys. We need to focus on
                radical Islamic terrorists and we need to stop them before they carry out acts of
                terror. [applause]</speech>
            <speech speaker="BASH"> Thank you. Senator Rubio, Senator Cruz is right there was
                bipartisan support for that. But you voted against it. So, is Senator Cruz

                voted for it because they wanted to keep it alive and they were afraid the whole
                program would expire. Here's the world we live in. This is a radical jihadist group
                that is increasingly sophisticated in its ability, for example, to radicalize
                American citizens, in its inability to exploit loopholes in our legal <keyword term="immigration system">immigration
                system</keyword>, in its ability to capture and hold territory in the Middle East, as I
                outlined earlier, in multiple countries. This is not just the most capable, it is
                the most sophisticated terror threat we have ever faced. We are now at a time when
                we need more tools, not less tools. And that took we lost, the metadata program, was
                a valuable tool that we no longer have at our disposal.</speech>

            <speech speaker="CRUZ"> Well, you know, I would note that Marco knows what he's saying
                isn't true. You know, Mark Levin wrote a column last week that says that the attack
                ads his Super PAC is running that are saying the same thing, that they are knowingly
                false and they are, in fact, Alinsky-like attacks like Barack Obama. And the reason
                is simple. What he knows is that the old program covered 20 percent to 30 percent of
                phone numbers to search for terrorists. The new program covers nearly 100 percent.
                That gives us greater ability to stop acts of terrorism, and he knows that that's
                the case.</speech>
            <speech speaker="RUBIO"> Dana, may I interject here?</speech>
            <speech speaker="BASH"> Senator — Senator — Senator Rubio, please respond.</speech>
            <speech speaker="RUBIO"> Let me be very careful when answering this, because I don't
                think national television in front of 15 million people is the place to discuss
                classified information. So let me just be very clear. There is nothing that we are
                allowed to do under this bill that we could not do before. This bill did, however,
                take away a valuable tool that allowed the National Security Agency and other law —
                and other intelligence agencies to quickly and rapidly access phone records and
                match them up with other phone records to see who terrorists have been calling.
                Because I promise you, the next time there is attack on — an attack on this country,
                the first thing people are going to want to know is, why didn't we know about it and
                why didn't we stop it? And the answer better not be because we didn't have access to
                records or information that would have allowed us to identify these killers before
                they attacked. [crosstalk] [applause]</speech>

                after 9/11, make a decision about how to proceed forward with an investigation or
                how to pull back, whether you use certain actionable intelligence or whether not to.
                And yet they continue to debate about this bill and in the subcommittee and what —
                nobody in America cares about that. What they care about is, are we going to have a
                president who actually knows what they're doing to make these decisions? And for the
                seven years afterwards, New Jersey was threatened like no other region in this
                country and what we did was we took action within the constitution to make sure that
                law enforcement had all the information they needed. We prosecuted two of the
                biggest terrorism cases in the world and stopped Fort Dix from being attacked by six
                American radicalized Muslims from a Mosque in New Jersey because we worked with the
                Muslim American community to get intelligence and we used the Patriot Act to get
                other intelligence to make sure we did those cases. This is the difference between
                actually been a federal prosecutor, actually doing something, and not just spending
                your life as one of hundred debating it. Let's talk about how we do this, not about
                which bill, which one these guys like more. The American people don't care about
                that.</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Thank you. Dr. Carson, you're in favor of monitoring mosques
                and schools where there is anti-America sentiment, what do you consider anti-
                America?</speech>
            <speech speaker="CARSON"> First of all, let me just complain a little bit. This is the
                first time I've spoken and several people have had multiple questions so please try
                to pay attention to that. Now, as far as monitoring is concerned, what my point is,
                we need to make sure that any place – I don't care whether it's a mosque, a school,
                a supermarket, a theater, you know it doesn't matter. If there are a lot of people
                getting there and engaging in radicalizing activities then we need to be suspicious
                of it. We have to get rid of all this PC stuff. And people are worried about if
                somebody's going to say that I'm Islamophobic or what have you. This is craziness
                because we are at war. That's why I asked congress, go ahead and declare the war .
                We need to be on a war footing. We need to understand that our nation is in grave
                danger. You know, what the Muslim Brotherhood said in the explanatory memorandum
                that was discovered during the Holy Land Foundation Trial was that, "they will take
                advantage of our PC attitude to get us. :" We have to be better than this. We have
                to be smarter than they are.</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Dr. Carson, who was right in that little debate that we just
                heard between Senator Rubio and Senator Paul?</speech>
            <speech speaker="CARSON"> I think you have to ask them about that. I don't want to get
                in between them. Let them fight. [crosstalk]</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Hold on a sec, we have a lot more to come and everybody's
                going to have their full opportunity. Governor Bush, six days after 9/11 your
                brother visited a mosque and said quote, "Islam is peace." The conversation tonight
                is about banning Muslims and surveillance of mosques, are President Bush's words
                still relevant in today's Republican party?</speech>
            <speech speaker="BUSH"> They are relevant if we want to destroy ISIS. If we want to
                destroy radical Islamic terrors, we can't disassociate ourselves from peace loving
                Muslims. If we expect to do this on our own, we will fail but if we do it in unison
                with people who are also are at risk and threatened by Islamic Radical terrorism,
                we'll be far more successful. Look, the FBI has the tools necessary un-American
                activities in our country. It goes on, we shouldn't even be talking about it, to be
                honest with you out in the public. Of course they have those capabilities and we
                should make sure that we give the FBI, the NSA, our intelligence communities, all
                the resources they need to keep us safe. But the main thing we should be focused on
                is the strategy to destroy ISIS. And I laid out a plan that the Reagan Library
                before the tragedy of Paris, and before San Bernardino to do just that. It requires
                leadership, it's not filing an amendment and call it a success. It is developing a
                strategy, leading the world, funding it to make sure that we have a military that's
                second to none, and doing the job and making sure that we destroy ISIS there. That's
                how you keep America safe.</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Ms. Fiorina, as you pointed out you were a CEO in Silicon
                Valley on 9/11. Companies there, they say they won't help the FBI now crack
                encrypted communication from ISIS, should they be forced to.</speech>
            <speech speaker="FIORINA"> You know, listening to this conversation, let me just say, we
                have a lot of argument about laws but none of it solves the problem. Let's examine
                what happened, why did we miss the Tsarnaev brothers, why did we miss the San
                Bernardino couple? It wasn't because we had stopped collected metadata it was
                because, I think, as someone who comes from the technology world, we were using the
                wrong algorithms. This is a place where the private sector could be helpful because
                the government is woefully behind the technology curve. But secondly, the
                bureaucratic processes that have been in place since 9/11 are woefully inadequate as
                well. What do we now know? That DHS vets people by going into databases of known or
                suspected terrorists. And yet, we also know that ISIS is recruiting who are not in
                those databases. So of course, we're going to miss them. And then we now learn that
                DHS says, "No, we can't check their social media." For heaven's sakes, every parent
                in America is checking social media and every employer is as well, but our
                government can't do it. The bureaucratic procedures are so far behind. Our
                government has become incompetent, unresponsive, corrupt. And that incompetence,
                ineptitude, lack of accountability is now dangerous. It is why we need a different
                kind of leadership in the White House that understands how to get bureaucracies
                competent again.</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> But my question was: Should these Silicon Valley companies be
                forced to cooperate with the FBI?</speech>
            <speech speaker="FIORINA"> They do not need to be forced. They need to be asked to bring
                the best and brightest, the most recent technology to the table. I was asked as a
                CEO. I complied happily. And they will as well. But they have not been asked. That's
                why it cost billions of dollars to build an Obama website that failed because the
                private sector wasn't asked. [applause]</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Mr. Trump, you recently suggested closing that Internet up,
                those were your words, as a way to stop ISIS from recruiting online. Are you
                referring to closing down actual portions of the Internet? Some say that would put
                the U.S. in line with China and North Korea.</speech>
            <speech speaker="TRUMP"> Well, look, this is so easy to answer. ISIS is recruiting
                through the Internet. ISIS is using the Internet better than we are using the
                Internet, and it was our idea. What I wanted to do is I wanted to get our brilliant
                people from Silicon Valley and other places and figure out a way that ISIS cannot do
                what they're doing. You talk freedom of speech. You talk freedom of anything you
                want. I don't want them using our Internet to take our young, impressionable youth
                and watching the media talking about how they're masterminds — these are
                masterminds. They shouldn't be using the word "mastermind." These are thugs. These
                are terrible people in ISIS, not masterminds. And we have to change it from every
                standpoint. But we should be using our brilliant people, our most brilliant minds to
                figure a way that ISIS cannot use the Internet. And then on second, we should be
                able to penetrate the Internet and find out exactly where ISIS is and everything
                about ISIS. And we can do that if we use our good people. [applause]</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Let me follow up, Mr. Trump. So, are you open to closing
                parts of the Internet?</speech>
            <speech speaker="TRUMP"> I would certainly be open to closing areas where we are at war
                with somebody. I sure as hell don't want to let people that want to kill us and kill
                our nation use our Internet. Yes, sir, I am.</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Thank you. Governor Kasich, is shutting down any part of the
                Internet a good idea?</speech>
            <speech speaker="KASICH"> No, I don't think it is. And I want to go back to two other
                issues. One is the metadata. We know we have to hold this data for a longer period
                of time. And, you know, in a lot of ways, Chris is right. Look, what a president has
                to do is take a position. We don't want to err on the side of having less. We want
                to err on the side of having more. That's good for our families. In addition to
                that, Wolf, there is a big problem. It's called encryption. And the people in San
                Bernardino were communicating with people who the FBI had been watching. But because
                their phone was encrypted, because the intelligence officials could not see who they
                were talking to, it was lost. We have to solve the encryption problem. It is not
                easy. A president of the United States, again, has to bring people together, have a
                position. We need to be able to penetrate these people when they are involved in
                these plots and these plans. And we have to give the local authorities the ability
                to penetrate to disrupt. That's what we need to do. Encryption is a major problem,
                and Congress has got to deal with this and so does the president to keep us safe.
                [applause]</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Thank you, Governor. The fight against radical Islamic
                terrorists and ISIS has been called the war of our time. So let's talk about how
                each of you, as commander in chief, would fight this war and win it. Senator Cruz,
                you have said you would, quote, "carpet bomb ISIS into oblivion," testing whether,
                quote, "sand can glow in the dark." Does that mean leveling the ISIS capital of
                Raqqa in Syria where there are hundreds of thousands of civilians?</speech>
            <speech speaker="CRUZ"> What it means is using overwhelming air power to utterly and
                completely destroy ISIS. To put things in perspective, in the first Persian Gulf
                War, we launched roughly 1,100 air attacks a day. We carpet bombed them for 36 days,
                saturation bombing, after which our troops went in and in a day and a half mopped up
                what was left of the Iraqi army. Right now, Obama is launching between 15 and 30 air
                attacks a day. It is photo op foreign policy. We need to use overwhelming air power.
                We need to be arming the Kurds. We need to be fighting and killing ISIS where they
                are. And let me go back to the earlier discussion a minute ago. It's not a lack of
                competence that is preventing the Obama administration from stopping these attacks.
                It is political correctness. We didn't monitor the Facebook posting of the female
                San Bernardino terrorist because the Obama DHS thought it would be inappropriate.
                She made a public call to jihad, and they didn't target it. The Tsarnaev brothers,
                the elder brother made a public call to jihad and the Obama administration didn't
                target it. Nidal Hasan communicated with Anwar al-Awlaki, a known radical cleric,
                asked about waging jihad against his fellow soldiers. The problem is because of
                political correctness, the Obama administration, like a lot of folks here, want to
                search everyone's cell phones and e-mails and not focus on the bad guys. And
                political correctness is killing people.</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Thank you. To be clear, Senator Cruz, would you carpet bomb
                Raqqa, the ISIS capital, where there are a lot of civilians, yes or no?</speech>
            <speech speaker="CRUZ"> You would carpet bomb where ISIS is, not a city, but the
                location of the troops. You use air power directed — and you have embedded special
                forces to direction the air power. But the object isn't to level a city. The object
                is to kill the ISIS terrorists. To make it — listen, ISIS is gaining strength
                because the perception is that they're winning. And President Obama fuels that
                perception. That will change when militants across the globe see that when you join
                ISIS that you are giving up your life, you are signing your death warrant, and we
                need a president who is focused on defeating every single ISIS terrorist and
                protecting the homeland, which should be the first priority.</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Thank you. Thank you, Senator. Senator Rubio, you've been
                critical of Senator Cruz's strategy. You say his voting record doesn't match his
                rhetoric. Why?</speech>
            <speech speaker="RUBIO"> Well, let me begin by saying that we have to understand who
                ISIS is. ISIS is a radical Sunni group. They cannot just be defeated through air
                strikes. Air strikes are a key component of defeating them, but they must be
                defeated on the ground by a ground force. And that ground force must be primarily
                made up of Sunni Arabs themselves, Sunni Arabs that reject them ideologically and
                confront them militarily. We will have to embed additional American special
                operators alongside them to help them with training, to help them conduct special
                missions, and to help improve the air strikes. The air strikes are important, but we
                need to have an air force capable of it. And because of the budget cuts we are
                facing in this country, we are going to be left with the oldest and the smallest Air
                Force we have ever had. We have to reverse those cuts, in addition to the cuts to
                our Navy and in addition to the cuts to our Army, as well. And beyond that, I would
                say we must win the information war against ISIS. Every war we have ever been
                involved in has had a propaganda informational aspect to it. ISIS is winning the
                propaganda war. They are recruiting people, including Americans, to join them, with
                the promise that they are joining this great apocalyptic movement that is going to
                defeat the West. We have to show what life is really like in ISIS territory, and we
                have to show them why ISIS is not invincible, by going out and conducting these
                attacks and publicizing them to those who they recruit.</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Because I asked the question, Senator, because you said this.
                You said he, referring to Senator Cruz, voted against the Defense Authorization Act
                every year that it came up, and I assume that if he voted against it, he would veto
                it as president. That's the bill that funds our troops.</speech>
            <speech speaker="RUBIO"> That is accurate. Three times he voted against the Defense
                Authorization Act, which is a bill that funds the troops. It also, by the way, funds
                the Iron Dome and other important programs. And I have to assume that if you vote
                against it in the Senate, you would also veto it as president. He has also
                supported, by the way, a budget that is called the containment budget. And it is a
                budget that would radically reduce the amount of money we spend on our military. You
                can't carpet bomb ISIS if you don't have planes and bombs to attack them with. And
                if we continue those cuts that we're doing now, not to mention additional cuts, we
                are going to be left with the oldest and the smallest Air Force this country has
                ever had, and that leaves us less safe.</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Senator Cruz?</speech>
            <speech speaker="CRUZ"> Well, you know, Marco has continued these attacks, and he knows
                they're not true. Yes, it is true that I voted against the National Defense
                Authorization Act, because when I campaigned in Texas I told voters in Texas that I
                would oppose the federal government having the authority to detain U.S. citizens
                permanently with no due process. I have repeatedly supported an effort to take that
                out of that bill, and I honored that campaign commitment.</speech>
            <speech speaker="CRUZ"> But more broadly, you know, the notion Marco is suggesting, that
                somehow — he also has tossed more than a few insults this direction — let's be
                absolutely clear. ISIS and radical Islamic terrorism will face no more determined
                foe than I will be. We will utterly destroy them by targeting the bad guys. And one
                of the problems with Marco's foreign policy is he has far too often supported
                Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama undermining governments in the Middle East that
                have helped radical Islamic terrorists. We need to focus on killing the bad guys,
                not getting stuck in Middle Eastern civil wars that don't keep America
                safe.</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Senator Rubio.</speech>
            <speech speaker="RUBIO"> Yes, let me — three points of distinction. The first is, if
                you're an American citizen and you decide to join up with ISIS, we're not going to
                read you your Miranda rights. You're going to be treated as an enemy combatant, a
                member of an army attacking this country. [applause] Number two, we do need our
                defense capabilities. It is a fact that the cuts we are facing today and the cuts
                that Senator Cruz would have supported would leave us with an even smaller Air Force
                and a smaller Navy than the one we are going to be left with. And the final point
                that I would make is Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama's strategy is to lead from
                behind. It sounds like what he is outlining is not to lead at all. We cannot
                continue to outsource foreign policy. We must lead. We are the most powerful nation
                in the world. We need to begin to act like it, again. [applause]</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> We are going to have much more on this...</speech>
            <speech speaker="PAUL"> Wolf...</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> We're going to have much more on this. But I want to move now
                back to Mr. Trump.</speech>
            <speech speaker="PAUL"> Wolf, this legislation...</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.</speech>
            <speech speaker="PAUL"> This legislation on indefinite detention...</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> We have a lot...</speech>
            <speech speaker="PAUL"> ... I think deserves a little more attention.</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> We have a lot to discuss. I want to move to Mr. Trump right
                now. We have a question on this war against ISIS and how you would fight and win
                this war. Here's the question from Facebook. Listen to this. [start video] JOSH
                JACOB, COLLEGE STUDENT: I'm Josh Jacob from Georgia Tech. Recently Donald Trump
                mentioned we must kill the families of ISIS members. However, this violates the
                principle of distinction between civilians and combatants in international law. So
                my question is, how would intentionally killing innocent civilians set us apart from
                ISIS? [end video]</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Mr. Trump.</speech>
            <speech speaker="TRUMP"> We have to be much tougher. We have to be much stronger than
                we've been. We have people that know what is going on. You take a look at just the
                attack in California the other day. There were numerous people, including the
                mother, that knew what was going on. They saw a pipe bomb sitting all over the
                floor. They saw ammunition all over the place. They knew exactly what was going on.
                When you had the World Trade Center go, people were put into planes that were
                friends, family, girlfriends, and they were put into planes and they were sent back,
                for the most part, to Saudi Arabia. They knew what was going on. They went home and
                they wanted to watch their boyfriends on television. I would be very, very firm with
                families. Frankly, that will make people think because they may not care much about
                their lives, but they do care, believe it or not, about their families' lives.

            <speech speaker="BUSH"> This is another example of the lack of seriousness. Look, this
                is — this is troubling because we're at war. They've declared war on us and we need
                to have a serious strategy to destroy ISIS. But the idea that that is a solution to
                this is just — is just crazy. It makes no sense to suggest this. Look, two months
                ago Donald Trump said that ISIS was not our fight. Just two months ago he said that
                Hillary Clinton would be a great negotiator with Iran. And he gets his foreign
                policy experience from the shows. That is not a serious kind of candidate. We need
                someone that thinks this through. That can lead our country to safety and security.

            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Mr. Trump.</speech>
            <speech speaker="TRUMP"> Look, the problem is we need toughness. Honestly, I think Jeb
                is a very nice person. He's a very nice person. But we need tough people. We need
                toughness. We need intelligence and we need tough. Jeb said when they come across
                the southern border they come as an act of love.</speech>
            <speech speaker="BUSH"> You said on September 30th that ISIS was not a factor.</speech>

            <speech speaker="BUSH"> I'm talking right now. I'm talking.</speech>
            <speech speaker="TRUMP"> You can go back. You're not talking. You interrupted

            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> One at a time.</speech>
            <speech speaker="TRUMP"> Look, look, look. We need a toughness. We need strength. We're
                not respected, you know, as a nation anymore. We don't have that level of respect
                that we need. And if we don't get it back fast, we're just going to go weaker,
                weaker and just disintegrate. We can't allow that to happen. We need strength. We
                don't have it. When Jeb comes out and he talks about the border, and I saw it and I
                was witness to it, and so was everyone else, and I was standing there, "they come
                across as an act of love," he's saying the same thing right now with radical Islam.
                And we can't have that in our country. It just won't work. We need
                strength.</speech>

                Leadership, leadership is not about attacking people and disparaging people.
                Leadership is about creating a serious strategy to deal with the threat of our time.
                And I laid out that strategy before the attacks in Paris and before the attacks in
                San Bernardino. And it is the way forward. We need to increase our military
                spending. We need to deal with a no- fly zone in Syria, a safe zone. We need to
                focus on building a military that is second-to-none...</speech>

            <speech speaker="HEWITT"> Dr. Carson...[applause]... you mentioned in your opening
                remarks that you're a pediatric neurologist surgeon...</speech>
            <speech speaker="CARSON"> Neurosurgeon.</speech>
            <speech speaker="HEWITT"> Neurosurgeon. And people admire and respect and are inspired
                by your life story, your kindness, your evangelical core support. We're talking
                about ruthless things tonight — carpet bombing, toughness, war. And people wonder,
                could you do that? Could you order air strikes that would kill innocent children by
                not the scores, but the hundreds and the thousands? Could you wage war as a
                commander-in-chief?</speech>
            <speech speaker="CARSON"> Well, interestingly enough, you should see the eyes of some of
                those children when I say to them we're going to have to open your head up and take
                out this tumor. They're not happy about it, believe me. And they don't like me very
                much at that point. But later on, they love me. Sometimes you — I sound like him.
                [applause] You know, later on, you know, they really realize what's going on. And by
                the same token, you have to be able to look at the big picture and understand that
                it's actually merciful if you go ahead and finish the job, rather than death by
                1,000 pricks.</speech>
            <speech speaker="HEWITT"> So you are OK with the deaths of thousands of innocent
                children and civilian? It's like...</speech>
            <speech speaker="CARSON"> You got it. You got it.</speech>
            <speech speaker="HEWITT"> That is what war — can you be as ruthless as Churchill was in
                prosecuting the war against the Nazis?</speech>
            <speech speaker="CARSON"> Ruthless is not necessarily the word I would use, but tough,
                resolute, understanding what the problems are, and understanding that the job of the
                president of the United States is to protect the people of this country and to do
                what is necessary in order to get it done. [applause]</speech>
            <speech speaker="BASH"> Senator Paul, you said ISIS grew stronger because of the hawks
                in your party. Do you really think that Republicans have fueled the rise of
                ISIS?</speech>
            <speech speaker="PAUL"> I think that by arming the allies of ISIS, the Islamic rebels
                against Assad, that we created a safe space or made that space bigger for ISIS to
                grow. I think those who have wanted regime change have made a mistake. When we
                toppled Gadhafi in Libya, I think that was a mistake. I think ISIS grew stronger, we
                had a failed state, and we were more at risk. I'd like to also go back to, though,
                another question, which is, is Donald Trump a serious candidate? The reason I ask
                this is, if you're going to close the Internet, realize, America, what that entails.
                That entails getting rid of the First amendment, OK? It's no small feat. If you are
                going to kill the families of terrorists, realize that there's something called the
                Geneva Convention we're going to have to pull out of. It would defy every norm that
                is America. So when you ask yourself, whoever you are, that think you're going to
                support Donald Trump, think, do you believe in the Constitution? Are you going to
                change the Constitution? [applause]</speech>
            <speech speaker="TRUMP"> So, they can kill us, but we can't kill them? That's what
                you're saying. And as far as the Internet is concerned, we're not talking about
                closing the Internet. I'm talking about parts of Syria, parts of Iraq, where ISIS
                is, spotting it. Now, you could close it. What I like even better than that is
                getting our smartest and getting our best to infiltrate their Internet, so that we
                know exactly where they're going, exactly where they're going to be. I like that
                better. [applause] But we have to — who would be — I just can't imagine somebody
                booing. These are people that want to kill us, folks, and you're — you're objecting
                to us infiltrating their conversations? I don't think so. I don't think so.
                [applause]</speech>
            <speech speaker="BASH"> Senator Paul, Senator Paul, I want to go back to my initial
                question, which is you saying that ISIS grew stronger because of hawks in your
                party. And do you think your own party, the people who you're describing, are
                responsible for the rise of ISIS?</speech>
            <speech speaker="PAUL"> I think that if you believe in regime change, you're mistaken.
                In 2013, we put 600 tons of weapons — us, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar — into the war
                against Assad. By pushing Assad back, we did create a safe space. We had people
                coming to our Foreign Relations Committee and saying, "Oh, we need to arm the allies
                of Al Qaida." They are still saying this. It is a crazy notion. This is the biggest
                debate we should be having tonight is is regime change a good idea; has it been a
                good idea. There are still people — the majority on the stage, they want to topple
                Assad. And then there will be chaos, and I think ISIS will then be in charge of
                Syria.</speech>
            <speech speaker="BASH"> Senator, we're going to talk about regime change in a bit. But
                Governor Kasich, would you like to respond to Senator Paul?</speech>
            <speech speaker="KASICH"> Yeah, let me — let me just suggest to everybody, and I hear —
                last February, I said we needed to have people on the ground in a coalition with
                Europe and our allies. This is not going to get done just by working with the
                Sunnis. And it is not going to get done if we just embed a few people. We have to go
                massively, like we did in the first Gulf War where we destroyed Saddam's ability to
                take Kuwait. We need to have a coalition that will stand for nothing less than the
                total destruction of ISIS and we have to be the leader. We can't wait for anybody
                else. I served on the Armed Services Committee for 18 years and we must lead, or the
                job won't get done, unfortunately, for our country [applause]</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Thank you, Governor. Senator Rubio? Let's continue this
                conversation. This is a critically important issue.</speech>
            <speech speaker="FIORINA"> I hope at some point you're going to ask me my
                strategy.</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> We will get to — we have a lot of time, Ms. Fiorina. I want
                to get to Senator Rubio right now. Let's talk about, one of the aspects of your
                strategy, you say the only way to defeat ISIS is with ground forces made up
                primarily of Sunni-Arab forces. Those Arab nations, though, as you well know,
                they've conducted less than five percent of the airstrikes and actually none since
                August. What makes you think they are willing to fight on the ground if they're not
                even willing to fight from the air?</speech>
            <speech speaker="RUBIO"> Well, they most certainly will have to be worked on to provide
                more than what they are doing now. There's no doubt about it. And there's one — one
                major reason why they have not been willing to be a broader part of the coalition,
                and that is they have lost complete trust and confidence in this president. This
                president cut a deal with their moral enemy, the Shia, in Iran. And this is the
                reason why they no longer trust this president and are willing to work alongside
                them. But they have as much invested in this as we do. In fact, more so, for it is
                the king of Saudi Arabia they want to behead first. It's the king of Jordan that
                they want to dethrone. It's the — they want to go into Egypt the way they've already
                gone into Libya. And on another point that we need to talk about, Assad is one of
                the main reasons why ISIS even exists to begin with. Assad is a puppet of Iran. And
                he has been so brutal toward the Sunni within Syria that he created the space that
                led to the people of Syria themselves to stand up and try to overthrow him. That led
                to the chaos which allowed ISIS to come in and take advantage of that situation and
                grow more powerful. And the fact that this president led from behind meant there
                were no alternative groups on the ground to be empowered, leaving ISIS with the
                prime operating space they needed to become the force they have now become.
                [crosstalk]</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Thank you, Senator. Stand by. [applause] Ms. Fiorina, the
                former defense secretary, Bob Gates, says the chances of getting Sunni-Arab forces
                on the ground to get the job done, his words, "chances very remote." What's your
                strategy?</speech>
            <speech speaker="FIORINA"> Well, first I'll just point out that talking tough is not the
                same as being strong. And to wage war, we need a commander in chief who has made
                tough calls in tough times and stood up to be held accountable over and over, not
                first-term senators who've never made an executive decision in their life. One of
                the things I would immediately do, in addition to defeating them here at home, is
                bring back the warrior class — Petraeus, McChrystal, Mattis, Keane, Flynn. Every
                single one of these generals I know. Every one was retired early because they told
                President Obama things that he didn't want to hear. We must have Sunni-Arabs
                involved in this coalition. We must commit leadership, strength, support and
                resolve. I'll just add that Margaret Thatcher once said, "If you want something
                talked about, ask a man; if you want something done, ask a woman."
                [applause]</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Thank you. Governor Christie, what's your strategy?</speech>
            <speech speaker="CHRISTIE"> Wolf, you sit up here and you listen to this stuff, and you
                think that so many of these people have had so much to do in this national debate,
                they talk like they were bystanders. You know, we talk about our military being
                degraded over time, and yet we've had folks on this stage who've been a part of
                Congress who have participated in sequester; who participated in the degrading of
                this military over time. And that's why I think people get so frustrated with
                Washington, D.C. now. That's why they're so angry with the — the electorate is so
                angry with everybody who is involved in government in Washington, D.C. Because if
                you listen to the folks up here, you think that they weren't even there; they had
                nothing to do with this. This is a difference between being a governor and being in
                a legislature. See, because when something doesn't work in New Jersey, they look at
                me, say: "Why didn't it get done? Why didn't you do it?" You have to be responsible
                and accountable. And so on ISIS, let's be clear, the president needs to be a force
                that is trusted in the world. On this I agree with Marco. You know, this president
                is not trusted. If you're the King of Jordan, if you're a part of the royal family
                in Saudi Arabia and he's made this deal with Iran which gives them $150 billion to
                wage a war and try to extend their empire across the Middle East, why would you want
                to do it now? But I will tell you this, when I stand across from King Hussein of
                Jordan and I say to him, "You have a friend again sir, who will stand with you to
                fight this fight," he'll change his mind.</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Dr. Carson, what is your strategy?</speech>
            <speech speaker="CARSON"> First of all, I've been talking about this for over a year. We
                have to destroy their caliphate because that gives them legitimacy to go ahead with
                the global Jihad. We have to take their energy because they are — ISIS is the
                richest terrorist organization there is. We have to take their oil, shut down all of
                the mechanisms whereby they can disperse money because they go after disaffected
                individuals from all over the place, and they're able to pay them. That makes a
                difference. As far as the command centers are concerned in Raqqa and to a lesser
                degree Mosul, cut those off. Do the same kind of thing that we did with Sinjar a few
                weeks ago, working with our embedded special forces with the Kurds, shut off the
                supply route, soften them up, then we go in with specials ops followed by our air
                force to take them over. Those are things that work. But also, you know, this whole
                concept of boots on the ground, you know, we've got a phobia about boots on the
                ground. If our military experts say, we need boots on the ground, we should put
                boots on the ground and recognize that there will be boots on the ground and they'll
                be over here, and they'll be their boots if we don't get out of there now.</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Thank you. Everyone stand by. We're only just beginning.
                Coming up, which candidates on this stage tonight want to move foreign policy in a
                dramatically new direction? We'll be right back. [commercial break]</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Welcome back to the CNN-Facebook Republican Presidential
                Debate here at the Venetian, Las Vegas. The war against ISIS will pose many new
                challenges for the next commander-in-chief. The last two presidents pursued a Middle
                East policy that supported toppling dictators to try to promote democracy. Senator
                Cruz, you have said the world would be safer today if Saddam Hussein were still in
                power in Iraq, Moammar Gadhafi ruled Libya, and Hosni Mubarak ruled Egypt. So would
                it be your policy to preserve dictatorships, rather than promoting democracy in the
                Middle East?</speech>
            <speech speaker="CRUZ"> Wolf, I believe in a America first foreign policy, that far too
                often President Obama and Hillary Clinton — and, unfortunately, more than a few
                Republicans — have gotten distracted from the central focus of keeping this country
                safe. So let's go back to the beginning of the Obama administration, when Hillary
                Clinton and Barack Obama led NATO in toppling the government in Libya. They did it
                because they wanted to promote democracy. A number of Republicans supported them.
                The result of that — and we were told then that there were these moderate rebels
                that would take over. Well, the result is, Libya is now a terrorist war zone run by
                jihadists. Move over to Egypt. Once again, the Obama administration, encouraged by
                Republicans, toppled Mubarak who had been a reliable ally of the United States, of
                Israel, and in its place, Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood came in, a terrorist
                organization. And we need to learn from history. These same leaders — Obama,
                Clinton, and far too many Republicans — want to topple Assad. Assad is a bad man.
                Gadhafi was a bad man. Mubarak had a terrible human rights record. But they were
                assisting us — at least Gadhafi and Mubarak — in fighting radical Islamic
                terrorists. And if we topple Assad, the result will be ISIS will take over Syria,
                and it will worsen U.S. national security interests. And the approach, instead of
                being a Woodrow Wilson democracy promoter...</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Thank you.</speech>
            <speech speaker="CRUZ"> ... we ought to hunt down our enemies and kill ISIS rather than
                creating opportunities for ISIS to take control of new countries.</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Senator. [applause] Senator
                Rubio, you supported the removal of Moammar Gadhafi in Libya. Now that country is in
                turmoil, as ISIS is clearly growing there. Senator Cruz says you haven't learned
                your lesson. Do you have any regrets for supporting President Obama's intervention
                in Libya?</speech>
            <speech speaker="RUBIO"> To begin with, Moammar Gadhafi and the revolt against Gadhafi
                was not started by the United States. It was started by the Libyan people. And the
                reason why I argued we needed to get involved is because he was going to go one way
                or the other. And my argument then was proven true, and that is, the longer that
                civil war took, the more militias would be formed and the more unstable the country
                would be after the fact. As far as Moammar Gadhafi is concerned, by the way, Moammar
                Gadhafi is the man that killed those Americans over Lockerbie, Scotland. Moammar
                Gadhafi is also the man that bombed that cafe in Berlin and killed those Marines.
                And you want to know why Moammar Gadhafi started cooperating on his nuclear program?
                Because we got rid of Saddam Hussein. And so he got scared that he would be next,
                and that's why he started cooperating. Look, we will have to work around the world
                with less than ideal governments. The government in Saudi Arabia is not a democracy,
                but we will have to work with them. The government in Jordan is not perfect, but we
                will have to work with them. But anti-American dictators like Assad, who help
                Hezbollah, who helped get those IEDs into Iraq, if they go, I will not shed a
                tear.</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Senator Cruz?</speech>
            <speech speaker="CRUZ"> Well, it's more than not shedding a tear. It's actively getting
                involved to topple a government. And we keep hearing from President Obama and
                Hillary Clinton and Washington Republicans that they're searching for these mythical
                moderate rebels. It's like a purple unicorn. They never exist. These moderate rebels
                end up being jihadists. And I'll tell you whose view on Assad is the same as mine.
                It's Prime Minister Netanyahu. Prime Minister Netanyahu has said Israel doesn't have
                a dog in that fight because Assad is a puppet of Iran, a Shia radical Islamic
                terrorist, but at the same time, Prime Minister Netanyahu doesn't want to see Syria
                governed by ISIS. And we need to focus on American interests, not on global
                aspirations... [crosstalk]</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Standby. Everybody standby for a moment. Governor Kasich, go
                ahead.</speech>
            <speech speaker="KASICH"> I don't understand this thing about Assad. He has to go. Assad
                is aligned with Iran and Russia. The one thing we want to prevent is we want to
                prevent Iran being able to extend a Shia crescent all across the Middle East. Assad
                has got to go. And there are moderates there. There are moderates in Syria who we
                should be supporting. I do not support a civil war. I don't want to be policeman of
                the world. But we can't back off of this. And let me tell you, at the end, the
                Saudis have agreed to put together a coalition inside of Syria to stabilize that
                country.</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Thank you.</speech>
            <speech speaker="KASICH"> He must go. It will be a blow to Iran and Russia.</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> We're going to talk about Assad in a moment. Mr. Trump, are
                Americans safer with dictators running the world in the Middle East?</speech>
            <speech speaker="TRUMP"> In my opinion, we've spent $4 trillion trying to topple various
                people that frankly, if they were there and if we could've spent that $4 trillion in
                the United States to fix our roads, our bridges, and all of the other problems; our
                airports and all of the other problems we've had, we would've been a lot better off.
                I can tell you that right now. We have done a tremendous disservice, not only to
                Middle East, we've done a tremendous disservice to humanity. The people that have
                been killed, the people that have wiped away, and for what? It's not like we had
                victory. It's a mess. The Middle East is totally destabilized. A total and complete
                mess. I wish we had the $4 trillion or $5 trillion. I wish it were spent right here
                in the United States, on our schools, hospitals, roads, airports, and everything
                else that are all falling apart. [applause]</speech>
            <speech speaker="FIORINA"> That is exactly what President Obama said. I'm amazed to hear
                that from a republican presidential candidate. But let's just start with, who got it
                wrong? Who really got it wrong? Hillary Clinton has gotten every foreign policy
                challenge wrong. Hitting the reset button with Vladimir Putin – recall that she
                called Bashar Al-Assad a positive reformer and then she opened an embassy and then
                later she said, over, and over, and over again, "Bashar Al-Assad must go." Although
                she wasn't prepared to do anything about it. Recall that Hillary Clinton was all for
                toppling Gadhafi then didn't listen to her own people on the ground. And then of
                course, when she lied about the terrorist attack in Benghazi, she invited more
                terrorist attacks.</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Thank you. Mr. Trump?</speech>
            <speech speaker="TRUMP"> Well, there's nothing to respond to. Well, people feel
                differently. I mean, the fact is Benghazi was a disaster because of Libya,
                everything just fell into place. It could not have been worse. What do we have now?
                We have nothing. We've spent $3 trillion and probably much more – I have no idea
                what we've spent. Thousands and thousands of lives, we have nothing. Wounded
                warriors all over the place who I love, we have nothing for it. And by the way – and
                Ben said incorrectly – and I'm not saying this as a knock – he's one of finest men.
                You're not going to find a finer men. But I've been talking about oil for three
                years. I've been saying,, "take the oil, take the oil." I didn't say, "just bomb
                it," I said," take it and use it and distribute it so that the wounded warriors -"
                People, I've been saying this now for many years.</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> All right.</speech>
            <speech speaker="TRUMP"> Now, all of a sudden everybody's saying, "take the oil." It
                wasn't so fashionable to take the oil six months ago. I've been saying it for
                years.</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Thank you.</speech>
            <speech speaker="FIORINA"> We've mismanaged going into Iraq.</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Dr. Carson, is the Middle East...</speech>
            <speech speaker="FIORINA"> We've mismanaged going out of Iraq.</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Dr. Carson, is the Middle East better off with
                dictators?</speech>
            <speech speaker="CARSON"> No one is ever better off with dictators but there comes a
                time you know, when you're on an airplane, they always say, "in case of an emergency
                oxygen masks will drop down. Put yours on first and then administer help to your
                neighbor." We need oxygen right now. And we need to start thinking about the needs
                of the American people before we go and solve everybody else's problems. The fact of
                the matter is, is that the Middle East has been in turmoil for thousands of years.
                For us to think that we're going to in there and fix that with a couple of little
                bombs and a few little decorations is relatively foolish.</speech>
            <speech speaker="FIORINA"> We actually...</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Governor Bush.</speech>
            <speech speaker="BUSH"> I think we're focusing a whole...</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Hold on Governor Bush., here's the question. You said,
                "getting rid of Saddam Hussein in your words was a pretty good deal." In light of
                what has happened in Iraq, do you still feel that way?</speech>
            <speech speaker="BUSH"> I do. I think the lesson's learned are that we have to have to
                have a strategy to get and a strategy to get out. Which means, that you create a
                stable situation. This president and this is what the focus ought to be, it's not
                the differences between us, it's Barack Obama does not believe America's leadership
                in the world is a force for good. He does not believe that our strength is a place
                where security can take place. He leads from behind. He creates an environment that
                now we're creating the most unstable situation we've had since the World War II era.
                The focus ought to be on the single fact that Hillary Clinton wants to double down
                on a failed foreign policy and we need to be united to defeat that because we're
                going to be in a place that is far less secure than it is today. Don't you all
                agree?</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Senator Paul, was getting rid of Saddam Hussein a pretty good
                deal?</speech>
            <speech speaker="PAUL"> These are the fundamental questions of our time, these foreign
                policy questions, whether or not regime change is a good idea or a bad idea. I don't
                think because I think the regime change was a bad idea it means that Hussein was
                necessarily a good idea. There is often variations of evil on both sides of the war.
                What we have to decide is whether or not regime change is a good idea. It's what the
                neoconservatives have wanted. It's what the vast majority of those on the stage
                want. They still want regime change. They want it in Syria. They wanted it in Iraq.
                They want it in Libya. It has not worked. Out of regime change you get chaos. From
                the chaos you have seen repeatedly the rise of radical Islam. So we get this
                profession of, oh, my goodness, they want to do something about terrorism and yet
                they're the problem because they allow terrorism to arise out of that chaos.

            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> These are the rules all of you agreed to. Hugh, go ahead with
                your question.</speech>
            <speech speaker="HEWITT"> Mr. Trump, we are talking about the most important thing,
                that's why it's heated. And it's, you are OK with Mr. Assad staying in power, but
                you are also in favor of winning. If he stays in power, Iran is winning, Hezbollah
                is winning. Iran is winning in Yemen. They are winning everywhere. If they are
                winning how can we be winning?</speech>
            <speech speaker="TRUMP"> I think Assad is a bad guy, a very bad guy, all right? Lots of
                people killed. I think we are backing people we have no idea who they are. The
                rebels, we call them the rebels, the patriotic rebels. We have no idea. A lot of
                people think, Hugh, that they are ISIS. We have to do one thing at a time. We can't
                be fighting ISIS and fighting Assad. Assad is fighting ISIS. He is fighting ISIS.
                Russia is fighting now ISIS. And Iran is fighting ISIS. We have to do one thing at a
                time. We can't go — and I watched Lindsey Graham, he said, I have been here for 10
                years fighting. Well, he will be there with that thinking for another 50 years. He
                won't be able to solve the problem. We have to get rid of ISIS first. After we get
                rid of ISIS, we'll start thinking about it. But we can't be fighting Assad. And when
                you're fighting Assad, you are fighting Russia, you're fighting — you're fighting a
                lot of different groups. But we can't be fighting everybody at one time.</speech>
            <speech speaker="HEWITT"> Governor Christie, is he right? Because if we step back, Iran
                goes nuclear. Is Donald Trump right?</speech>
            <speech speaker="CHRISTIE"> Well, I think we have to focus, Hugh, on exactly what the
                priorities are. And to me, what I've always said is that the president has set up an
                awful situation through his deal with Iran, because what his deal with Iran has done
                is empower them and enrich them. And that's the way ISIS has been created and formed
                here. ISIS is created and formed because of the abuse that Assad and his Iranian
                sponsors have rained down on the Sunnis in Syria. And so when we empower Iran, this
                is why this president — and when Hillary Clinton says her theory against ISIS will
                be just about the same as the president, then get ready for more unrest and more
                murder and more violence in the Middle East. We need to focus our attention on Iran,
                because if you miss Iran, you are not going to get ISIS. The two are inextricably
                connected because one causes the other.</speech>
            <speech speaker="HEWITT"> Senator Paul, let me ask you, you heard Governor Kasich say
                Assad must go. Do you agree?</speech>
            <speech speaker="PAUL"> No, I think it's a huge mistake. I think regime change in Syria,
                and this is what — I've been saying this for several years now. In 2013 when we
                first went in, I said, you are going to give arms to the allies of al Qaida, to
                radical jihadists? That's crazy. But the other thing I said is the great irony is
                you will be back fighting against your own weapons. Had Assad been bombed when he
                used chemical weapons two years ago, ISIS would be in charge of all of Syria now. We
                have to have a more realistic foreign policy and not a utopian one where we say, oh,
                we're going to spread freedom and democracy, and everybody in the Middle East is
                going to love us. They are not going to love us. [applause] [crosstalk]</speech>
            <speech speaker="KASICH"> The foreign policy, you have to know how to pick and choose.
                There's no way, if Saddam had not had weapons of mass destruction, I would have
                gone, because I don't believe that the U.S. should be involved directly in civil
                wars. I opposed the U.S. involvement in Lebanon. We ended up having to withdraw our
                marines after our barracks were blown up. There is a difference between Iraq, where
                you have Sunni, Shia, and Kurds put together after the First World War by the
                Western powers. It doesn't work. It needs to break up into three parts. And for the
                Russians, frankly, it's time that we punched the Russians in the nose. They've
                gotten away with too much in this world and we need to stand up against them, not
                just there, but also in Eastern Europe where they threaten some of our most precious
                allies.</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Let's continue with Russia right now. We have another
                question from Facebook. Listen and watch. [start video]</speech>
            <speech speaker="QUESTION"> My name is Ashley Tofil. Ms. Fiorina, in November, you said
                that you would not talk to Vladimir Putin after you were elected because you would
                be communicating from a position of weakness. Do you believe that it is feasible to
                not communicate with another world leader? And do you think that that also is a sign
                of weakness? [end video]</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Ms. Fiorina, as you know, U.S. and Russian warplanes are
                flying all over Syria right now. With so many lives on the line, is this a good time
                for the United States not to talk to Putin?</speech>
            <speech speaker="FIORINA"> I didn't say I would cut off all communication with Putin.
                What I said was as president of the United States, now is not the time to talk with
                him. Reagan walked away at Reykjavik. There is a time and a place for everything.
                There is a time and a place for talk. And there is a time and a place for action. I
                know Vladimir Putin. He respects strength. He lied to our president's face; didn't
                both to tell him about warplanes and troops going into Syria. We need to speak to
                him from a position of strength. So as commander in chief, I will not speak to him
                until we've set up that no-fly zone; until we've gathered our Sunni-Arab allies and
                begun to deny ISIS territory; until I've called the supreme leader of Iran and told
                him new deal — new deal. We the United States of America are going to cut off the
                money flow, which we can do; which we don't need anyone's permission or
                collaboration to do. And I will not speak to him personally until we've rebuilt the
                6th Fleet a little bit right under his nose; rebuilt the missile defense program in
                Poland right under his nose; and conducted a few military exercises in the Baltic
                states. And let us remember one other thing. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are
                responsible for the growth of ISIS because they precipitously withdrew from Iraq in
                2011 against the advice of every single general and for political expediency. It's
                not these people up here. It's Hillary Clinton. [applause]</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Thank you, Ms. Fiorina. Governor Christie, if the U.S.
                imposed a no-fly zone over Syria and a Russian plane encroached, invaded that no-fly
                zone, would you be prepared to shoot down that Russian plane and risk war with
                Russia?</speech>
            <speech speaker="CHRISTIE"> Not only would I be prepared to do it, I would do it. A
                no-fly zone means a no-fly zone, Wolf. That's what it means. [applause] See, maybe —
                maybe because I'm from New Jersey, I just have this kind of plain language hangup.
                But I would make very clear — I would not talk to Vladimir Putin. In fact, I would
                talk to Vladimir Putin a lot. But I'd say to him, "Listen, Mr. President, there's a
                no-fly zone in Syria; you fly in, it applies to you." And yes, we would shoot down
                the planes of Russian pilots if in fact they were stupid enough to think that this
                president was the same feckless weakling that the president we have in the Oval
                Office is right now. [applause]</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Senator Paul — Senator Paul, I want you to respond to what we
                just heard from Governor Christie. If there was a no-fly zone, you say that
                potentially could lead to World War III. Why?</speech>
            <speech speaker="PAUL"> Well, I think if you're in favor of World War III, you have your
                candidate. You know, here's...[applause]... the thing. My goodness, what we want in
                a leader is someone with judgment, not someone who is so reckless as to stand on the
                stage and say, "Yes, I'm jumping up and down; I'm going to shoot down Russian
                planes." Russia already flies in that airspace. It may not be something we're in
                love with the fact that they're there, but they were invited by Iraq and by Syria to
                fly in that airspace. And so if we announce we're going to have a no-fly zone, and
                others have said this. Hillary Clinton is also for it. It is a recipe for disaster.
                It's a recipe for World War III. We need to confront Russia from a position of
                strength, but we don't need to confront Russia from a point of recklessness that
                would lead to war. This is something — this type of judgment, you know, it's having
                that kind of judgment; who you would appoint and how you're going to conduct
                affairs, that is incredibly important. I mean, I think when we think about the
                judgment of someone who might want World War III, we might think about someone who
                might shut down a bridge because they don't like their friends; they don't want to —
                you know, they want to [inaudible] a Democrat. So I think we need to be very
                careful.</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Governor Christie?</speech>
            <speech speaker="CHRISTIE"> Well, Wolf, I'll tell you what reckless is. What reckless is
                is calling Assad a reformer. What reckless is allowing Russia to come into Crimea
                and Ukraine. What reckless is is inviting Russia into Syria to team with Iran. That
                is reckless. And the reckless people are the folks in the White House right now.
                Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are the reckless people. And if you think that a
                no-fly zone is a reckless policy, you're welcome to your opinion. But how is it
                working so far? As we have 250,000 Syrians murdered, slaughtered; millions running
                around the world, running for their lives. It's not working. We need to try
                something else. And that is not reckless. [applause]</speech>
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> All right, let's go back — Hugh and Dana?</speech>
            <speech speaker="HEWITT"> Governor Bush, a commander-in-chief question. You've said that
                Mr. Trump is not qualified to be president because he's not qualified to deal with
                Vladimir Putin. Why are you better qualified to deal with Vladimir Putin than Mr.
                Trump?</speech>
            <speech speaker="BUSH"> Because I — first of all, I know what I don't know. I know what
                I don't know. I would seek out, as I have, the best advice that exists. I won't get
                my information from the shows. I don't know if that's Saturday morning or Sunday
                morning. I don't know which one. [laughter] I will seek out the best advice, and I
                will create a strategy and I will persuade the American people what the role of
                America should be. I've laid out a policy of rebuilding our military. All of the
                talk that we're seeing here — most of which I agree on, frankly — requires a much
                stronger military. We now have a lack of readiness that is quite scary. We have
                planes that were — that Harry Truman inaugurated, the B-52. We have — the Navy has
                been gutted and decimated. The readiness of the Marines is way down. If we're
                serious about America's leadership in the world, then we need to make sure that we
                have the back of the armed forces. The Armed Forces Radio is here listening to this
                today. I hope they know that if I'm president, I'll be a commander-in-chief, not an
                agitator- in-chief or a divider-in-chief, that I will lead this country in a way
                that will create greater security and greater safety.</speech>
            <speech speaker="HEWITT"> Mr. Trump?</speech>
            <speech speaker="TRUMP"> I think it's very sad that CNN leads Jeb Bush, Governor Bush,
                down a road by starting off virtually all the questions, "Mr. Trump this, Mister" —
                I think it's very sad. And, frankly, I watched — I think it's very sad. And,
                frankly, I watched the first debate, and the first long number of questions were,
                "Mr. Trump said this, Mr. Trump said that. Mr. Trump" — these poor guys — although,
                I must tell you, Santorum, good guy. Governor Huckabee, good guy. They were very
                nice, and I respect them greatly. But I thought it was very unfair that virtually
                the entire early portion of the debate was Trump this, Trump that, in order to get
                ratings, I guess. In order to get ratings, I guess.</speech>
            <speech speaker="HEWITT"> But, Mr. Trump, it's not CNN — I was on CNN last

            <speech speaker="HEWITT"> Dr. Carson, commander-in-chief question again. You've been the
                head of neurosurgery for a big hospital. You're on a lot of boards of a lot of
                companies. You've traveled the world. You're going traveling again next week. But
                does that prepare you to command troops from Djibouti to Japan, troops from
                Afghanistan to Iraq to be in charge of the men and women watching on Armed Services
                Network tonight?</speech>
            <speech speaker="CARSON"> Well, you know, there's a false narrative that only the
                political class has the wisdom and the ability to be commander-in- chief. But if you
                go back and you study the design of our country, it was really designed for the
                citizen statesman. And we need to be talking about where does your experience come
                from? You know, and I've had a lot of experience building things, organizing things,
                you know, a national scholarship program. One of the things that you'll notice if
                you look through my life is that I don't do a lot of talking. I do a lot of doing.
                And really, it says more about a person than how much they talk. And then some
                people say you're weak because, you know, you're not loud and you're not boisterous
                and you're not rude. But the fact of the matter is, look and see what I've done. And
                that speaks volumes about strength.</speech>
        </section>
        <section key="imm">

            <speech speaker="BASH"> Thank you, Dr. Carson. We've been talking tonight about programs
                and policy proposals that you all have to keep Americans safe and it's a big
                discussion on the campaign trail. Also about <keyword term="border">border</keyword>
                security and <immigration status="ambig" term="immigration"
                    >immigration</immigration>. So let's talk about <immigration status="ambig"
                    term="immigration">immigration</immigration>. Senator Rubio. You co-authored a
                bill with Democrats two years ago that allowed a <keyword term="path">path to
                    citizenship</keyword> for <immigrant status="illegal"
                    term="undocumented immigrant">undocumented immigrants</immigrant>. Do you still
                support that <keyword term="path">path to citizenship</keyword>, which means giving
                those <immigrant status="illegal" term="immigrant">immigrants</immigrant> rights,
                like the right to vote?</speech>

            <speech speaker="RUBIO"> Yeah. <anecdote type="value" subtype="culture" attitude="ambig"
                        ><immigration status="ambig" term="immigration"> Immigration</immigration>
                    is not an issue that I read about in the newspaper or watch a documentary on PBS
                    or CNN. It's an issues I've lived around my whole life. My family are
                    immigrants. My wife's family are <immigrant status="ambig" term="immigrant">immigrants</immigrant>. All of my neighbors are <immigrant status="ambig" term="immigrant">immigrants</immigrant>.
                    I see every aspect of this problem. The good, the bad, and the ugly. And here's
                    what we learned in 2013. The American people don't trust the Federal Government
                    to enforce our immigration laws, and we will not be able to do anything on
                    immigration until we first prove to the American people that <immigration status="illegal" term="illegal immigration">illegal immigration</immigration>
                    is under control. And we can do that. We know what it takes to do
                    that.</anecdote> It takes at least 20,000 more additional <keyword term="border"
                    >border</keyword> agents. It takes completing those 700 miles of fencing. It
                takes a mandatory <keyword term="e-verify">e-verify</keyword> system and a mandatory
                entry/exit tracking system to prevent overstays. After we have done that, the second
                thing we have to do is reform and modernize the legal <keyword
                    term="immigration system">immigration system</keyword>.<trope type="value"
                    subtype="culture" attitude="pro"> And after we have done those two things, I
                    think the American people are gonna be reasonable with what do you do with
                    someone who has been in this country for 10 or 12 years who hasn't otherwise
                    violated our laws — because if they're a criminal they can't stay. They'll have
                    to undergo a background check, pay a fine, start paying taxes. And ultimately,
                    they'll given a work permit and that's all they're gonna be allowed to have for
                    at least 10 years.</trope> But you can't get to that third step until you have
                done the other two things, and that was the lesson we learned in 2013. There is no
                trust that the Federal Government will enforce the law. They will not support you
                until you see it done first.</speech>

            <speech speaker="BASH"> Senator, you haven't answered the question. You described a very
                long path but does that path end at citizenship?</speech>

            <speech speaker="RUBIO"> But I've answered that question repeatedly. I am personally
                open — after all that has happened and after ten years in that probationary status
                where all they have is a permit, I personally am open to allowing people to apply
                for a green card. That may not be a majority position in my party, but that's down
                the road. You can't even begin that process until you prove to people — not just
                pass a law that says you're gonna bring <immigration status="illegal"
                    term="illegal immigration">illegal immigration</immigration> under control.
                You're gonna have to do it and prove to people that it's working. And that was the
                lesson of 2013. And it's more true today, than it was then. After a migratory crisis
                on the <keyword term="border">border</keyword> with minors coming over that you're
                seeing start up again now, after all these executive orders the President has
                issued. More than ever we need to...</speech>

            <speech speaker="BASH"> Thank you, senator.</speech>

            <speech speaker="RUBIO"> ... prove to people that <immigration status="illegal"

            <speech speaker="BASH"> Thank you, senator. Senator Cruz. [applause] Senator Cruz, on
                the campaign trail, Senator Rubio has said that his <immigration status="ambig"
                    term="immigration">immigration</immigration> plan is not that different from
                yours. Is that true?</speech>

            <speech speaker="CRUZ"> Well, he — he has attempted to muddy the waters, but I think
                that anyone who watched the battle that we had. You know, there was a time for
                choosing as Reagan put it. Where there was a battle over <keyword term="amnesty"
                    >amnesty</keyword> and some chose, like Senator Rubio to stand with Barack Obama
                and Chuck Schumer and support a massive <keyword term="amnesty">amnesty</keyword>
                plan. Others chose to stand with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and the American
                people and secure the <keyword term="border">border</keyword>. And let me mention,
                this issue is actually directly connected to what we've been talking about. <trope

                troubling aspects of the Rubio-Schumer Gang of Eight Bill was that it gave President
                Obama blanket authority to admit refugees, including <immigrant status="refugee"

                    letting people in, when the FBI can't vet them, it puts American citizens at

            <speech speaker="BASH"> Senator Rubio, please.</speech>

            <speech speaker="RUBIO"> Yeah, a couple points. In 2013 we had never faced a crisis like

                crisis now. Up until that point, a <immigrant status="refugee" term="refugee"
                    >refugee</immigrant> meant someone fleeing oppression, fleeing Communism like it
                is in my community. As far as Ted's record, I'm always puzzled by his attack on this
                issue. Ted, you support legalizing people who are in this country illegally. Ted
                Cruz supported a 500-percent increase in the number of H-1 visas, the <immigrant
                    status="legal" term="guest worker">guest workers</immigrant> that are allowed
                into this country, and Ted supports doubling the number of green cards. So I think
                what's important for us to understand and there is a way forward on this issue that
                we can bring our country together on. And while I'm president I will do it. And it
                will begin by bringing <immigration status="illegal" term="illegal immigration"
                    >illegal immigration</immigration> under control and proving to the American
                people.</speech>

            <speech speaker="CRUZ"> Look, I understand Marco wants to raise confusion, it is not
                accurate what he just said that I supported legalization. Indeed, I led the fight
                against his legalization and <keyword term="amnesty">amnesty</keyword>. And you
                know, there was one commentator that put it this way that, for Marco to suggest our

                both at the scene of the fire." He was fighting to grant <keyword term="amnesty"

            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Governor, thank you very much. So, Dr. Carson, you recently
                visited a refugee camp in Jordan and you deemed it your words, "really quite nice."
                Saying the people there didn't want to come to the United States. Do you think these
                camps are a long-term solution of the problem of Syrian refugees?</speech>

            <speech speaker="CARSON"> Well, it was very interesting having an opportunity to talk to
                the Syrians themselves. And I asked them: What do you want? What is your supreme
                desire? Their supreme desire was to be settled back in their own country. I said,
                "What can Americans and other countries do?" They said, "Support the efforts of
                those who are trying to provide safety for us, including the Jordanians." Of course,
                they had a brand new hospital, for instance, that was unstaffed because there wasn't
                enough money to do it. But here's what's really neat. If you go into Hasakah
                province in northeast Syria, that's an area that's as big as Lebanon. It's
                controlled by the Kurds, the Christians and the moderate Sunnis. And there are
                airstrips and hotels. You could settle a lot of people there. All we would have to
                do is be willing to provide them with some weaponry, some defensive weaponry. And we
                seem to be afraid to give the Kurds weaponry. We like to send it for some strange
                reason through Baghdad, and then they only get a tenth of it. And if we would
                support them, we'd have a perfect ideal there. We don't need to set this up as we
                either take a bunch of <keyword term="refugee">refugees</keyword> who will be
                infiltrated with terrorists, I guarantee you. For them not to be would be terrorist
                malpractice. And we need to — to choose the right choice, not these false
                choices.</speech>

            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Senator Paul, you oppose letting in <immigrant
                    status="refugee" term="syrian refugee">Syrian refugees</immigrant> at this time
                into the United States. The U.S. has already accepted 2,000 <immigrant
                    status="refugee" term="syrian refugee">Syrian refugees</immigrant>, including 13
                living here in Las Vegas right now. Would you send them back? What would you do with
                these people?</speech>

            <speech speaker="PAUL"> You know, I think we need to set the record straight on this,
                because I think Marco misspoke about the bill. <anecdote type="secure"
                    subtype="terrorism" attitude="anti">On the Gang of Eight bill, there was no
                    provisions really for extra scrutiny or safety for <immigrant status="refugee"
                        term="refugee">refugees</immigrant>. At the time the bill came up, two
                        <immigrant status="refugee" term="iraqi refugee">Iraqi refugees</immigrant>
                    came to my home town, Bowling Green, Kentucky. Their fingerprints were on a bomb
                    from Iraq. They were in the database, but we didn't pick them up.</anecdote>
                <anecdote type="econ" subtype="welfare" attitude="anti">We relocated them here, put
                    them in government housing, got them on food stamps. And we began providing for
                    them, but we didn't have adequate security.</anecdote> On the Gang of Eight
                bill, on Marco's bill, we had an opportunity. There was a conservative consensus for
                an amendment I put forward called Trust, But Verify that would have strengthened
                border security on both refugees, students and those coming here. And Marco sided
                and I guess was more sympathetic to Chuck Schumer and to the president than he was
                to conservative principles. But this goes directly to national defense. And if he
                wants to run as a national — national defense conservative, he's got to explain why
                he hasn't stepped up to support <keyword term="border">border</keyword>
                security.</speech>

            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Senator Rubio? [applause]</speech>

            <speech speaker="RUBIO"> Well, he's just admitted — as he's just admitted, the reason
                why those <immigrant status="refugee" term="refugee">refugees</immigrant> were
                allowed in was because they messed up in how they used the actual database. They
                should have known. They didn't because they didn't run the actual law as it exists
                now. It didn't work well.<trope type="secure" subtype="terrorism" attitude="anti">
                    As far as the <immigrant status="refugee" term="refugee">refugees</immigrant>
                    are concerned, it's not that America doesn't want to accept refugees, Wolf. It's
                    that we may not be able to, because this is an issue we have to be 100 percent
                    right on. If we allow 9,999 Syrian refugees into the United States, and all of
                    them are good people, but we allow one person in who's an ISIS killer — we just
                    get one person wrong, we've got a serious problem.</trope> And there is not a

            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Senator Paul, you didn't answer the question about the 2,000

                who are already here in the United States. Will you send them back or let them

            <speech speaker="PAUL"> What my bill would do would be only for <immigrant
                    status="refugee" term="refugee">refugees</immigrant> going forward. So I haven't
                taken a position on sending anyone home. <trope type="econ" subtype="welfare"

                    everyone in government housing and food stamps and bring them in from around the

                    My church has helped people that came from Bosnia. That's a good thing. But we

                accepting <immigrant status="refugee" term="refugee">refugees</immigrant>? [end

            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Governor Christie, you say there should be a pause in
                allowing new <immigrant status="refugee" term="refugee">refugees</immigrant> to come
                into the United States, including orphans under the age of five. What do you say to
                Carla?</speech>

            <speech speaker="CHRISTIE"> What I say to Carla is that the first job of the president
                of the United States is to protect your safety and your security and the security
                and safety of your family. And this debate stops with me in the discussions with the
                FBI director. <anecdote type="secure" subtype="ambig" attitude="ambig">Now, listen,
                    I'm a former federal prosecutor, I know Jim Comey. We've worked together. He was
                    the U.S. attorney in Manhattan when I was a U.S. attorney in New Jersey. And
                    when Jim Comey gets up before Congress and says, we cannot effectively vet these
                    people, for me as president, that's the end of the conversation. We have to put
                    America's security first.</anecdote> [applause] The American people — we on this
                stage need to open our ears. We need to open our ears. The American people are not
                whispering to us. They are screaming to us. And they're screaming to us that it's
                our job to actually make this government work. It's so dysfunctional under Barack
                Obama and Hillary Clinton. It's so ineffective. It's so ineffectual that the
                American people say, we don't trust them to do anything anymore. So I'm not going to
                let <immigrant status="refugee" term="syrian refugee">Syrian refugees</immigrant>,
                any <immigrant status="refugee" term="syrian refugee">Syrian refugees</immigrant> in
                this country. And it was widows and orphans, by the way, and we now know from
                watching the San Bernardino attack that women can commit heinous, heinous acts
                against humanity just the same as men can do it. And so I don't back away from that
                position for a minute. When the FBI director tells me that he can vet those people,
                then we'll consider it and not a moment before because your safety and security is
                what's most important to me. [applause]</speech>

                very effective with our Joint Terrorism Task Force, being able to make busts. In
                fact, we just made one three-four weeks ago against a person who was favorable to
                ISIS living in Akron. But let me tell you what is interesting about the
                administration. We had Central American miners that were placed in Ohio, and we
                never knew a thing about it. We didn't know where they were. And, in fact, we know
                now that some of them, there is a case going on where some of them may have been
                human-trafficked. So when the administration tells me we have a great vetting
                process, the proof is in the pudding. They sent these miners to us. Our schools were
                disrupted. We didn't know where they were. And bad things happened to them. And now
                they tell me that we ought to be able to admit these <immigrant status="refugee"
                    term="syrian refugee">Syrian refugees</immigrant>. So, Wolf, look, people have
                accused me at times of having too big of a heart. You know, that's OK. But I have to
                also to say I must keep the people of my state safe. So we take a pause.</speech>

            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Thank you, Governor. There is much more coming up. We are
                only just beginning. Coming up, what other global hot spots await the next president
                of the United States. [applause] [commercial break]</speech>

        </section>
        <section key="other">
            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Welcome back to the CNN-Facebook Republican Presidential
                Debate. We're here at the Venetian Las Vegas. Tonight we have been focusing on the
                Middle East, but let's turn to some other world threats that you will potentially
                face as Commander in Chief. Ms. Fiorina, candidates here have called the North
                Korean leader Kim Jong-Un a maniac who is mentally unstable. Last week he said he
                now has a hydrogen bomb. If you were elected president, what would you do about Kim
                Jong-Un?</speech>

            <speech speaker="FIORINA"> Well, first, Kim Jong-Un is a dangerous leader, without a
                doubt. And both Republican and Democrat administrations have been completely
                ineffective in dealing with him. So we must continue to isolate him. We will need
                China as part of that strategy. China is a rising adversary. So one of the things we
                have to do if we want China's support is to push back on China. They, too, recognize
                one thing — strength and their own economic interest. I have done business in China
                for 25 years, so I know that in order to get China to cooperate with us, we must
                first actually retaliate against their cyber-attacks so they know we're serious. We
                have to push back on their desire to control the trade route through the South China
                Sea through which flows $5 trillion worth of goods and services every year. We
                cannot let them control the disputed islands, and we must work with the Australians,
                the South Koreans, the Japanese and the Filipinos to contain China. And then we must
                ask for their support and their help with North Korea. Because believe it or not,
                China is as concerned about Kim Jong-Un as we are.</speech>

            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Dr. Carson, what would you do about Kim Jong-Un?</speech>

            <speech speaker="CARSON"> Well, I definitely believe that he is unstable, and I do, in
                fact, believe that China has a lot more influence with him than we do. But we also
                recognize that North Korea is in severe financial straits, and they have decided to
                use their resources to build their military, rather than to feed their people and to
                take care of the various humanitarian responsibilities that they have. We can
                capitalize upon that. You know, we should use our economic power in lots of
                different ways. I think we can use that in order to keep Putin contained, because he
                is a one-horse show. Energy. And we have an abundance of energy, but we have archaic
                energy exportation rules. We need to get rid of those, allow ourselves to really
                make Europe dependent on us and other parts of the world dependent on us for energy.
                Put him back in his little box where he belongs. And, you know, we need to be doing
                lots of other things with the resources that we have. So economic power works just
                as well as military power, perhaps even better. And speaking of that, our Military
                needs to be upgraded. You know, you look at things like our Ohio Class submarines,
                they're 25 years old. Our minuteman 3 missiles — they are 34 years old. Our B-52
                bombers — 50 years old. You know, if we don't get the military right nothing else
                matters.</speech>

            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Thank you, Dr. Carson. Dana and Hugh you have questions as
                well.</speech>

            <speech speaker="BASH"> Governor Christie, you've said if China launches a cyber- attack
                against the U.S. on your watch, "they're going to see cyber- warfare like they have
                never seen before." What exactly would that response look like?</speech>

            <speech speaker="CHRISTIE"> Well, what it would like is, we have one of the great
                advantages of America being the open society that we are. It is, we are not hiding
                things from the American people, but China everyday is conducting business in a way
                that hides things from their people. So if they want to come in and attack all the
                personnel records in the federal government, which they've done, and which — they
                now have my Social Security number and my fingerprints, as well as maybe some other
                folks' who are on this stage. The fact is, they need to be fought back on. And what
                we need to do is go at the things that they are most sensitive and most embarrassing
                to them; that they're hiding; get that information and put it out in public. Let the
                Chinese people start to digest how corrupt the Chinese government is; how they steal
                from the Chinese people; and how they're enriching oligarchs all throughout China.
                They need to understand that. And we need to take those type of steps. This
                president has seen personnel records of people who have sacrificed for the American
                people and for the federal government stolen by the Chinese and he's done nothing in
                return. This is why — this is what I said at the beginning that this administration,
                Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton through their foreign policy, have betrayed the
                American people, because the weakness they've displayed has led to Putin's
                incursions in the Middle East and in eastern Europe, and has led — has led to
                significant problems in the Middle East as well, and the death and murder of lots of
                folks.</speech>

            <speech speaker="BASH"> Governor Bush, what you just heard from Governor Christie, are
                you concerned that that could really escalate with China, that they would retaliate?
                And, for example, as the NSA has said, attack the U.S. and maybe it's power grid,
                which the Chinese have the capability to do?</speech>

            <speech speaker="BUSH"> I completely agree with Chris. And this administration has been
                so lax. Think about it. Hillary Clinton is using a private server for — where
                classified information go by. This is a — this is a serious administration? The
                president receives an inspector general's report that the Office of Personnel
                Management could be hacked into; they had antiquated firewalls; 23 million files
                have been — are in the hands of the Chinese allegedly, including, by the way,
                members of the press, it turns out, last week. Maybe that's the only part that's
                good news, so that you guys can get a feel for what it's like now to see this type
                of attack. This is something — we have to have the best defensive capabilities. We
                need to coordinate all of our efforts with the private sector. We need to give them
                liability relief so that we can do that. And offensively, we need to have
                capabilities second to none. We need to create a situation where they know that
                there will be adverse impacts if they continue to do what they're doing. They'll
                respect that. They'll respect a United States that is serious about protecting our —
                our infrastructure. If we don't do it, we'll continue to see what's — exactly what's
                happening, not just from the Chinese, by the way. The Russians and rogue actors,
                including ISIS — this is a serious part of the 21st century security challenge that
                we face.</speech>

            <speech speaker="HEWITT"> Mr. Trump...[applause]... Dr. Carson just referenced the
                single most important job of the president, the command, the control and the care of
                our nuclear forces. And he mentioned the triad. The B-52s are older than I am. The
                missiles are old. The submarines are aging out. It's an executive order. It's a
                commander-in-chief decision. What's your priority among our nuclear triad?</speech>

            <speech speaker="TRUMP"> Well, first of all, I think we need somebody absolutely that we
                can trust, who is totally responsible; who really knows what he or she is doing.
                That is so powerful and so important. And one of the things that I'm frankly most
                proud of is that in 2003, 2004, I was totally against going into Iraq because you're
                going to destabilize the Middle East. I called it. I called it very strongly. And it
                was very important. But we have to be extremely vigilant and extremely careful when
                it comes to nuclear. Nuclear changes the whole ball game. Frankly, I would have said
                get out of Syria; get out — if we didn't have the power of weaponry today. The power
                is so massive that we can't just leave areas that 50 years ago or 75 years ago we
                wouldn't care. It was hand-to-hand combat. The biggest problem this world has today
                is not President Obama with global warming, which is inconceivable, this is what
                he's saying. The biggest problem we have is nuclear — nuclear proliferation and
                having some maniac, having some madman go out and get a nuclear weapon. That's in my
                opinion, that is the single biggest problem that our country faces right
                now.</speech>

            <speech speaker="HEWITT"> Of the three legs of the triad, though, do you have a
                priority? I want to go to Senator Rubio after that and ask him.</speech>

            <speech speaker="TRUMP"> I think — I think, for me, nuclear is just the power, the
                devastation is very important to me.</speech>

            <speech speaker="HEWITT"> Senator Rubio, do you have a response?</speech>

            <speech speaker="RUBIO"> I do. First, let's explain to people at home who the triad —
                what the triad is. Maybe a lot of people haven't heard that terminology before. The
                triad is our ability of the United States to conduct nuclear attacks using
                airplanes, using missiles launched from silos or from the ground, and also from our
                nuclear subs' ability to attack. And it's important — all three of them are
                critical. It gives us the ability at deterrence. Now, some have become more critical
                than others; for example, the submarines. And that's the Ohio Class submarine that
                needs to be modernized. The air component also needs to be modernized. The B-52, as
                someone earlier pointed out, is an outdated model that was flown by the grandparents
                of people that are flying it now. And we need a serious modernization program as
                well on our silo-launched missiles. All three are critical for the defense of the
                country.</speech>

            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Thank you, Senator Rubio. Some of you on this stage have
                questioned whether your opponents have temperament, the right temperament, to be in
                control of the nuclear codes. Dana, you have a question on this?</speech>

            <speech speaker="BASH"> Mr. Trump, just this weekend you said Senator Cruz is not
                qualified to be president because he doesn't have the right temperament and acted
                like a maniac when he arrived in the Senate. But last month you said you were open
                to naming Senator Cruz as your running mate.</speech>

            <speech speaker="TRUMP"> I did.</speech>

            <speech speaker="BASH"> So why would you be willing to put somebody who's a maniac one
                heartbeat away from the presidency?</speech>

            <speech speaker="TRUMP"> Let me just say that I have gotten to know him over the last
                three or four days. He has a wonderful temperament. [laughter] He's just fine. Don't
                worry about it. [applause]</speech>

            <speech speaker="BASH"> Okay. Senator Cruz. Senator Cruz, you have not been willing to
                attack Mr. Trump in public.</speech>

            <speech speaker="TRUMP"> You better not attack...[laughter]</speech>

            <speech speaker="BASH"> But you did question his judgment in having control of
                American's nuclear arsenal during a private meeting with supporters. Why are you
                willing to say things about him in private and not in public?</speech>

            <speech speaker="CRUZ"> Dana, what I said in private is exactly what I'll say here,
                which is that the judgment that every voter is making of every one of us up here is
                who has the experience, who has the vision, who has the judgment to be commander in
                chief. That is the most important decision for the voters to make. That's a standard
                I'm held to. And it's a standard everyone else is held to. And I will note, you
                know, in the whole course of this discussion about our foreign policy threats, it
                actually illustrates the need for clarity of focus. You know, my daughters, Caroline
                and Catherine, came tonight. They're 7 and 5. And you think about the Los Angeles
                schools canceling their schools today. And every parent is wondering, how do we keep
                our kids safe? We need a commander in chief who does what Ronald Reagan did with
                communism, which is he set out a global strategy to defeat Soviet communism. And he
                directed all of his...[crosstalk] I'm answering the question, Dana. He directed all
                of his forces to defeating communism. One of the things we've seen here is how easy
                it is for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton to get distracted from dealing with
                radical Islamic terrorism. They won't even call it by its name. We need a president
                who stands up, number one, and says, we will defeat ISIS. And number two, says the
                greatest national security threat facing America is a nuclear Iran.</speech>

            <speech speaker="BASH"> Senator, senator, I just...</speech>

            <speech speaker="CRUZ"> And we need to be focused on defeating...</speech>

            <speech speaker="BASH"> Senator, a lot of people have seen...</speech>

            <speech speaker="CRUZ"> ... defeating radical Islamic terrorists.</speech>

            <speech speaker="BASH"> ... a lot of people have seen these comments you made in
                private. I just want to clarify what you're saying right now is you do believe Mr.
                Trump has the judgment to be commander in chief?</speech>

            <speech speaker="CRUZ"> What I'm saying, Dana, is that is a judgment for every voter to
                make. What I can tell you is all nine of the people here would make an infinitely
                better commander in chief than Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton. [applause]</speech>

            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Thank you, senator. Thank you.</speech>

            <speech speaker="CRUZ"> And there is a real danger, Dana, when people get distracted.
                I'm answering the question, Wolf. There's a real danger when people get distracted
                by peripheral issues. They get distracted by democracy building. They get distracted
                about military conflicts. We need to focus on defeating jihadism. ISIS and Iran have
                declared war on America, and we need a commander in chief who will do everything
                necessary to keep our children safe.</speech>

            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Thank you, Senator.</speech>

            <speech speaker="CRUZ"> And I will do everything necessary to keep our children
                safe.</speech>

            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Thank you, Senator. We're a month and a half away now from
                the first real test who will be the Republican presidential nominee. Hugh, you have
                a question?</speech>

            <speech speaker="HEWITT"> My listeners tell me again and again they are worried that
                Hillary Clinton will win the White House because you'll run as an independent. Are
                you ready to assure Republicans tonight that you will run as a Republican and abide
                by the decision of the Republicans?</speech>

            <speech speaker="TRUMP"> I really am. I'll be honest, I really am. [applause] I mean,
                the people have been putting me...[applause] I really am. [applause]</speech>

            <speech speaker="HEWITT"> Dr. Carson, last week...</speech>

            <speech speaker="TRUMP"> Let me just. Can I just finish my...</speech>

            <speech speaker="HEWITT"> Please.</speech>

            <speech speaker="TRUMP"> I've gained great respect for the Republican leadership. I've
                gained great respect for many — and I'm going to even say — I mean, in different
                forms for the people on the dais, in different forms. [laughter] In different forms.
                But I have great respect for the people I have met through this process. I've never
                done this process before. I've never been a politician. I mean, for the last six
                months I've been a politician. But I will tell you, I am totally committed to the
                Republican Party. I feel very honored to be the front runner. [applause] And I think
                I'll do very well if I'm chosen. If I'm so fortunate to be chosen, I think I'll do
                very well. Polls have come out recently saying I would beat Hillary. I will do
                everything in my power to beat Hillary Clinton, I promise you. [applause]</speech>

            <speech speaker="HEWITT"> Dr. Carson, Mr. Trump just committed to stay the distance
                regardless of the result. How about you?</speech>

            <speech speaker="CARSON"> Well, you know, the statement that I made last week, that I
                would leave the party was contingent upon whether in fact the party acts like they
                have in the past with a lot of subterfuge and dishonesty, or like they're going act
                now because I spike to Reince Priebus, and he assured me that the Washington Post
                writer had it all wrong, and that they're not be engaging in anything to thwart the
                will of the people. That's why I got into this race, as a member of we the people,
                to try bring some honesty and integrity back to the process. [applause]</speech>

            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> All right. Candidates, we have more coming up. When we come
                back, everyone will have an opportunity to explain why this particular candidate,
                each of you on the stage, believes he or she should be the Republican presidential
                nominee. [applause] [commercial break]</speech>

            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Now it's time for the closing statements from the candidates.
                Each one has 30 seconds. Senator Paul.</speech>

            <speech speaker="PAUL"> The greatest threat to our national security is our debt. We
                borrow a million dollars a minute. And whose fault is it? Well, frankly, it's both
                parties' fault. You have those on the right who clamor and say, oh, we will spend
                anything on the military, and those on the left who say the same for domestic
                welfare. But what most Americans don't realize is there is an unholy alliance. They
                come together. There's a secret handshake. We spend more money on everything. And we
                are not stronger nation if we go further into debt. We are not projecting power from
                bankruptcy court. To me, there is no greater threat than our debt. I'm the only
                fiscal conservative on the stage because I'm willing to hold the line on all
                spending. I hope you will consider me in the election. Thank you very much.

            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Governor Kasich.</speech>

            <speech speaker="KASICH"> No Republican has ever been elected president of the United
                States without winning Ohio. Let me give you a little tip on how you win Ohio, it's
                reform, it's hope, it's growth, it's opportunity, and it's security. The people of
                Ohio are the people of America. The people of America are reflected in Ohio. Our
                message has to be big, and bold, and positive, and connect, not just with people's
                heads but also connect with their hearts. If we do it, we will beat Hillary Clinton,
                and we will run the White House, and we will strengthen and fix America, I promise
                you. [applause]</speech>

            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Governor Christie.</speech>

            <speech speaker="CHRISTIE"> On September 10th, 2001, I was named chief federal
                prosecutor in New Jersey and on September 11th, 2001, my wife and my brother who are
                in the audience tonight went through the World Trade Center and to their offices
                just blocks away from the Trade Center. I lost touch with them for six hours that
                day and prayed that they were alive. Luckily, they were sent home. But many of our
                friends and others in our neighborhood lost their lives that day. Terrorism —
                radical jihadist terrorism is not theoretical to me. It's real. And for seven years,
                I spent my life protecting our country against another one of those attacks. You
                won't have to worry when I'm President of the Untied States whether that can be done
                because I've already done it. I want the chance to do it again to protect you, your
                children and your families. If you give me the chance and give me your vote I will
                protect America from the wars that are being brought to our door step.</speech>

            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Ms. Fiorina.</speech>

            <speech speaker="FIORINA"> I too remember September 11th. I remember immediately putting
                into place security procedures all throughout our company that did business in 170
                countries where we thought corporate interests would be attacked next. To take our
                country back, to keep our nation safe, we have to begin by beating Hillary Clinton.
                We need to unify our party. We need to better than our government, which 75 percent
                of the American people now think is corrupt and incompetent. They're right. We need
                to better than our politics. 80 percent think we have a professional/political class
                of both parties that cares more about its power, position and privilege than
                actually on getting anything done. We need to unify our party, we need a real
                Conservative in the White House, and we need to beat Hillary Clinton to take our
                country back and keep our nation safe. I can. I am. And together, if you join me, we
                will take our country back.</speech>

            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Governor Bush.</speech>

            <speech speaker="BUSH"> Ask yourself, which candidate will keep you and our country
                safer, stronger and freer? Hillary Clinton has aligned herself with Barack Obama on
                ISIS, Iran and the economy. It's an alliance doomed to fail. My proven record
                suggests that — my detailed plans will fortify our national and economic security.
                And my proven record as governor makes — will give you a sense that I don't make
                false promises. I deliver real results. For America to be safe and sound, I ask for
                you support. Thank you all very much.</speech>

            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Senator Rubio.</speech>

            <speech speaker="RUBIO"> Thank you. As we near the end of this year, we enter one of the
                most important elections in a generation. For what's at stake in this election is
                not simply what party's going to be in charge. But our very identity as a people and
                as a nation. For over 200 years this has been a special country. A unique place
                where anyone from anywhere can achieve anything. But now millions of Americans feel
                like they're being left behind. Insecure in their future and unsafe in the face of
                terrorism. This election is about electing a president that will restore our
                economic vibrancy so that the American dream can expand to reach more people and
                change more lives than ever before. And rebuild our Military and our intelligence
                programs so that we can remain the strongest nation on earth. Tonight I ask you for
                your vote. If you do this, we will rebuild this country, and together we will usher
                in a new American century — the greatest era in the history of this great
                land.</speech>

            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Senator Cruz.</speech>

            <speech speaker="CRUZ"> Judgment, strength, clarity and trust. Barack Obama has said he
                doesn't believe in American leadership or America winning — he is wrong. America can
                win again and we will win again. Ronald Reagan reignited the American economy,
                rebuilt the Military, bankrupted the Soviet Union and defeated Soviet Communism. I
                will do the same thing. Cutting taxes, cutting regulation, unleashing small
                businesses and rebuilding the Military to defeat radical Islamic terrorism — our
                strategy is simple. We win, they lose. We've done it before and we can do it
                again.</speech>

            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Dr. Carson.</speech>

            <speech speaker="CARSON"> I've been fortunate enough to travel to 58 different countries
                and I thank God everyday that I was born in this country. The most exceptional
                country that the world has ever known. And I want to make sure that we preserve that
                exceptionalism for the next generation. My mother told me if I work hard and I
                really believed in American principles and I believed in God, anything is possible.
                I believe that is true, and that's why I'm not anxious to give away American values
                and principles for the sake of political correctness.</speech>

            <speech speaker="TRUMP"> Our country doesn't win anymore. We don't win on trade. We
                don't win on the military. We can't defeat ISIS. We're not taking care of our great
                people, the veterans. We're not taking care of them. We have to change our whole
                way, our health care system is a disaster. It's going to implode in 2017, just like
                you're sitting there. It doesn't work. Nothing works in our country. If I'm elected
                president, we will win again. We will win a lot. And we're going to have a great,
                great country, greater than ever before. Thank you. [applause]</speech>

            <speech speaker="BLITZER"> Thanks to all the Republican presidential candidates. That
                does it for this Republican presidential debate.</speech>
