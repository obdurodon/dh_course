              <p>Senator Mathias, Chief Justice Burger, Vice President Bush, Speaker O’Neill,
                     Senator Dole, Reverend Clergy, members of my family and friends, and my fellow
                     citizens:</p>
              <p>This day has been made brighter with the presence here of one who, for a time, has
                     been absent—Senator John Stennis.</p>
              <p><value type="religion">God bless you</value> and welcome back.</p>
              <p>There is, however, one who is not with us today: Representative Gillis Long of
                     Louisiana left us last night. <value type="religion">I wonder if we could all
                            join in a moment of silent prayer. (Moment of silent prayer.)
                            Amen</value>.</p>
              <p>There are no words adequate to express my thanks for the great honor that you have
                     bestowed on me. I will do my utmost to be deserving of your trust.</p>
              <p>This is, as Senator Mathias told us, the 50th time that we the people have
                     celebrated this historic occasion. <tone rhetoric="appeal_to_past">When the
                            first President, George Washington, placed his hand upon the Bible, he
                            stood less than a single day’s journey by horseback from raw, untamed
                            wilderness. There were 4 million Americans in a union of 13
                            States</tone>. Today we are 60 times as many in a union of 50 States.
                            <value type="science">We have lighted the world with our
                            inventions</value>, <policy foreign="internationalism">gone to the aid
                            of mankind wherever in the world there was a cry for help</policy>,
                            <value type="science">journeyed to the Moon and safely returned</value>.
                     So much has changed. <value type="unity">And yet we stand together as we did
                            two centuries ago</value>.</p>
              <p>When I took this oath four years ago, I did so in a time of economic stress. Voices
                     were raised saying we had to look to our past for the greatness and glory. But
                     we, the present-day Americans, <value type="progress">are not given to looking
                            backward. In this blessed land, there is always a better
                            tomorrow</value>.</p>
              <p>Four years ago, I spoke to you of a new beginning and we have accomplished that.
                     But in another sense, our new beginning is a continuation of that beginning
                     created two centuries ago when, for the first time in history, government, the
                     people said, was not our master, it is our servant; its only power that which
                     we the people allow it to have.</p>
              <p>That system has never failed us, but, for a time, we failed the system. <policy
                            government="small_government">We asked things of government that
                            government was not equipped to give. We yielded authority to the
                            National Government that properly belonged to States or to local
                            governments or to the people themselves</policy>. <policy
                            economy="industry">We allowed taxes and inflation to rob us of our
                            earnings and savings and watched the great industrial machine that had
                            made us the most productive people on Earth slow down and the number of
                            unemployed increase</policy>.</p>
              <p>By 1980, we knew it was time to renew our faith, to strive with all our strength
                     toward the ultimate in individual freedom consistent with an orderly
                     society.</p>
              <p>We believed then and now there are no limits to growth and human progress when men
                     and women are free to follow their dreams.</p>
              <p>And we were right to believe that. <policy economy="tax">Tax rates have been
                            reduced, inflation cut dramatically, and more people are employed than
                            ever before in our history</policy>.</p>
              <p>We are creating a nation once again vibrant, robust, and alive. <tone
                            emotion="stress">But there are many mountains yet to climb</tone>.
                            <value type="equality">We will not rest until every American enjoys the
                            fullness of freedom, dignity, and opportunity as our birthright</value>.
                     It is our birthright as citizens of this great Republic, and we’ll meet this
                     challenge.</p>
              <p><value type="progress">These will be years when Americans have restored their
                            confidence and tradition of progress; when our values of faith, family,
                            work, and neighborhood were restated for a modern age</value>; <policy

                            world</policy>; <value type="democracy">when Americans courageously
                            supported the struggle for liberty, self-government, and free enterprise
                            throughout the world, and turned the tide of history away from
                            totalitarian darkness and into the warm sunlight of human
                            freedom</value>.</p>
              <p><tone emotion="optimistic">My fellow citizens, our Nation is poised for
                            greatness</tone>. We must do what we know is right and do it with all
                     our might. Let history say of us, “These were golden years—when the American
                     Revolution was reborn, when freedom gained new life, when America reached for
                     her best.”</p>
              <p>Our two-party system has served us well over the years, but <value type="unity"
                            >never better than in those times of great challenge when we came
                            together not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans united in a
                            common cause</value>.</p>
              <p><tone rhetoric="appeal_to_past">Two of our Founding Fathers, a Boston lawyer named
                            Adams and a Virginia planter named Jefferson, members of that remarkable
                            group who met in Independence Hall and dared to think they could start
                            the world over again, left us an important lesson</tone>. They had
                     become political rivals in the Presidential election of 1800. Then years later,
                     when both were retired, and age had softened their anger, they began to speak
                     to each other again through letters. A bond was reestablished between those two
                     who had helped create this government of ours.</p>
              <p>In 1826, the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, they both died.
                     They died on the same day, within a few hours of each other, and that day was
                     the Fourth of July.</p>
              <p>In one of those letters exchanged in the sunset of their lives, Jefferson wrote:
                            “<policy government="self_government">It carries me back to the times
                            when, beset with difficulties and dangers, we were fellow laborers in
                            the same cause, struggling for what is most valuable to man, his right
                            to self-government</policy>. Laboring always at the same oar, with some
                     wave ever ahead threatening to overwhelm us, and yet passing harmless…we rode
                     through the storm with heart and hand.”</p>
              <p><value type="unity">Well, with heart and hand, let us stand as one today</value>:
                            <value type="religion">One people under God</value> determined that
                            <tone rhetoric="appeal_to_past">our future shall be worthy of our
                            past</tone>. As we do, we must not repeat the well-intentioned errors of
                     our past. <policy economy="tax">We must never again abuse the trust of working
                            men and women, by sending their earnings on a futile chase after the
                            spiraling demands of a bloated Federal Establishment</policy>. You
                     elected us in 1980 to end this prescription for disaster, and I don’t believe
                     you reelected us in 1984 to reverse course.</p>
              <p><policy economy="general">At the heart of our efforts is one idea vindicated by 25
                            straight months of economic growth: Freedom and incentives unleash the
                            drive and entrepreneurial genius that are the core of human
                            progress</policy>. <policy government="self_government">We have begun to
                            increase the rewards for work, savings, and investment; reduce the
                            increase in the cost and size of government and its interference in
                            people’s lives</policy>.</p>
              <p><policy economy="tax">We must simplify our tax system, make it more fair, and bring
                            the rates down for all who work and earn</policy>. <value
                            type="progress">We must think anew</value> and <value type="action">move
                            with a new boldness</value>, <value type="equality">so every American
                            who seeks work can find work; so the least among us shall have an equal
                            chance to achieve the greatest things</value>—<policy

                            nations</policy>, and leave this world a better place.</p>
              <p><value type="equality">The time has come for a new American emancipation—a great
                            national drive to tear down economic barriers and liberate the spirit of
                            enterprise in the most distressed areas of our country</value>. <tone
                            emotion="optimistic">My friends, together we can do this</tone>, and do
                     it we must, <value type="religion">so help me God</value>.</p>
              <p>From new freedom will spring new opportunities for growth, a more productive,
                     fulfilled and united people, and a stronger America—an <value type="science"
                            >America that will lead the technological revolution</value>, and also
                     open its mind and heart and soul to the treasures of literature, music, and
                     poetry, and the values of faith, courage, and love.</p>
              <p><policy economy="general">A dynamic economy, with more citizens working and paying
                            taxes, will be our strongest tool to bring down budget deficits. But an
                            almost unbroken 50 years of deficit spending has finally brought us to a
                            time of reckoning. We have come to a turning point, a moment for hard
                            decisions. I have asked the Cabinet and my staff a question, and now I
                            put the same question to all of you: If not us, who? And if not now,
                            when? It must be done by all of us going forward with a program aimed at
                            reaching a balanced budget. We can then begin reducing the national
                            debt</policy>.</p>
              <p>I will shortly submit a budget to the Congress aimed at freezing government program
                     spending for the next year. Beyond that, we must take further steps to
                     permanently <policy economy="tax">control Government’s power to tax and
                            spend</policy>. <tone rhetoric="appeal_to_future">We must act now to
                            protect future generations from Government’s desire to spend its
                            citizens’ money and tax them into servitude when the bills come
                            due</tone>. Let us make it unconstitutional for the Federal Government
                     to spend more than the Federal Government takes in.</p>
              <p>We have already started returning to the people and to State and local governments
                     responsibilities better handled by them. Now, there is a place for the Federal
                     Government in matters of social compassion. But our fundamental goals must be
                     to reduce dependency and upgrade the dignity of those who are infirm or
                     disadvantaged. And here a growing economy and support from family and community
                     offer our best chance for a society where compassion is a way of life, <value
                            type="equality">where the old and infirm are cared for</value>, the
                     young and, yes, <policy health="abortion">the unborn protected</policy>, and
                     the unfortunate looked after and made self-sufficient.</p>
              <p>And there is another area where the Federal Government can play a part. As an older
                     American, I remember a time when people of different race, creed, or ethnic
                     origin in our land found hatred and prejudice installed in social custom and,
                     yes, in law. <value type="equality">There is no story more heartening in our
                            history than the progress that we have made toward the “brotherhood of
                            man”</value> that <value type="religion">God intended for us</value>.Let
                     us resolve there will be no turning back or hesitation on the road to an <value
                            type="equality">America rich in dignity and abundant with opportunity
                            for all our citizens</value>.</p>
              <p><value type="equality">Let us resolve that we the people will build an American
                            opportunity society in which all of us—white and black, rich and poor,
                            young and old—will go forward together arm in arm</value>. Again, let us
                     remember that though our heritage is one of blood lines from every corner of
                     the Earth, we are all Americans pledged to carry on this last, best hope of man
                     on Earth.</p>
              <p>I have spoken of our domestic goals and the limitations which we should put on our
                     National Government. Now let me turn to a task which is the primary
                     responsibility of National Government—<value type="security">the safety and
                            security of our people</value>.</p>
              <p>Today, <value type="religion">we utter no prayer more fervently</value> than the
                     ancient prayer for peace on Earth. Yet history has shown that peace will not
                     come, nor will our freedom be preserved, by good will alone. <policy
                            foreign="internationalism">There are those in the world who scorn our
                            vision of human dignity and freedom. One nation, the Soviet Union, has
                            conducted the greatest military buildup in the history of man, building
                            arsenals of awesome offensive weapons</policy>.</p>
              <p>We have made progress in restoring our defense capability. But much remains to be
                     done. There must be no wavering by us, nor any doubts by others, <value
                            type="democracy">that America will meet her responsibilities to remain
                            free</value>, <value type="security">secure</value>, and at peace.</p>
              <p>There is only one way safely and legitimately to reduce the cost of national
                     security, and that is to reduce the need for it.<policy
                            foreign="internationalism"> And this we are trying to do in negotiations
                            with the Soviet Union. We are not just discussing limits on a further
                            increase of nuclear weapons. We seek, instead, to reduce their number.
                            We seek the total elimination one day of nuclear weapons from the face
                            of the Earth</policy>.</p>
              <p>Now, for decades, we and the Soviets have lived under the threat of mutual assured
                     destruction; if either resorted to the use of nuclear weapons, the other could
                     retaliate and destroy the one who had started it. Is there either logic or
                     morality in believing that if one side threatens to kill tens of millions of
                     our people, our only recourse is to threaten killing tens of millions of
                     theirs?</p>
              <p><policy military="war">I have approved a research program to find, if we can, a
                            security shield that would destroy nuclear missiles before they reach
                            their target. It wouldn’t kill people, it would destroy weapons. It
                            wouldn’t militarize space, it would help demilitarize the arsenals of
                            Earth. It would render nuclear weapons obsolete. We will meet with the
                            Soviets, hoping that we can agree on a way to rid the world of the
                            threat of nuclear destruction</policy>.</p>
              <p><value type="security">We strive for peace and security, heartened by the changes
                            all around us</value>. Since the turn of the century, the number of
                     democracies in the world has grown fourfold. Human freedom is on the march, and
                     nowhere more so than our own hemisphere. <value type="democracy">Freedom is one
                            of the deepest and noblest aspirations of the human spirit</value>.
                     People, worldwide, hunger for the right of self-determination, for those
                     inalienable rights that make for human dignity and progress.</p>
              <p><value type="democracy">America must remain freedom’s staunchest friend, for
                            freedom is our best ally</value>.</p>
              <p>And it is the world’s only hope, to <value type="equality">conquer poverty</value>
                     and preserve peace. <value type="equality">Every blow we inflict against
                            poverty will be a blow against its dark allies of oppression and
                            war</value>. <value type="democracy">Every victory for human freedom
                            will be a victory for world peace</value>.</p>
              <p>So we go forward today, a nation still mighty in its youth and powerful in its
                     purpose. With our alliances strengthened, with our economy leading the world to
                     a new age of economic expansion, <tone emotion="optimistic">we look forward to
                            a world rich in possibilities</tone>. <value type="unity">And all this
                            because we have worked and acted together, not as members of political
                            parties, but as Americans</value>.</p>
              <p>My friends, we live in a world that is lit by lightning. So much is changing and
                     will change, but so much endures, and transcends time.</p>
              <p>History is a ribbon, always unfurling; history is a journey. And as we continue our
                     journey, we think of those who traveled before us. We stand together again at
                     the steps of this symbol of our democracy—or we would have been standing at the
                     steps if it hadn’t gotten so cold. Now we are standing inside this symbol of
                     our democracy. <tone rhetoric="appeal_to_past">Now we hear again the echoes of
                            our past: a general falls to his knees in the hard snow of Valley Forge;
                            a lonely President paces the darkened halls, and ponders his struggle to
                            preserve the Union; the men of the Alamo call out encouragement to each
                            other; a settler pushes west and sings a song, and the song echoes out
                            forever and fills the unknowing air</tone>.</p>
              <p><tone emotion="pride">It is the American sound. It is hopeful, big-hearted,
                            idealistic, daring, decent, and fair. That’s our heritage; that is our
                            song</tone>. We sing it still. For all our problems, our differences, we
                     are together as of old, <value type="religion">as we raise our voices to the
                            God who is the Author of this most tender music. And may He continue to
                            hold us close as we fill the world with our sound—sound in unity,
                            affection, and love—one people under God, dedicated to the dream of
                            freedom that He has placed in the human heart, called upon now to pass
                            that dream on to a waiting and hopeful world</value>.</p>
              <p>
                     <value type="religion">Godbless you and may God bless America</value>. </p>
