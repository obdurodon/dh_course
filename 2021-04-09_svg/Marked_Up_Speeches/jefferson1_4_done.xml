        <p>Friends and Fellow-Citizens:</p>
        
        <p>CALLED upon to undertake the duties of the first executive office of our country, I
            avail myself of the presence of that portion of my fellow-citizens which is here
            assembled to express my <tone emotion = "optimism">grateful thanks for the favor with which they have been pleased
            to look toward me</tone>, to declare a sincere consciousness that <tone emotion = "humble">the task is above my talents</tone>,
            and that I approach it with those <tone emotion = "stressed">anxious and awful presentiments</tone> which the greatness of
            the charge and the weakness of my powers so justly inspire. A rising nation, spread over
            a wide and fruitful land, traversing all the seas with the rich productions of
            their industry, engaged in commerce with nations who feel power and forget right,
            advancing rapidly to destinies beyond the reach of mortal eye—when I contemplate
            these transcendent objects, and see the <tone emotion = "optimism">honor, the happiness, and the hopes</tone> of this
            beloved country committed to the issue, and the auspices of this day, <tone emotion = "humble">I shrink from
            the contemplation, and humble myself</tone> before the magnitude of the undertaking.
            Utterly, indeed, should I despair did not the presence of many whom I here see remind me
            that in the other high authorities provided by our Constitution I shall find resources
            of wisdom, of virtue, and of zeal on which to rely under all difficulties. To you,
            then, gentlemen, who are charged with the sovereign functions of legislation, and to
            those associated with you, <tone emotion = "optimism">I look with encouragement</tone> for that guidance and support which
            may enable us to steer with safety the vessel in which we are all embarked amidst
            the conflicting elements of a troubled world.</p>
        
        <p>During the contest of opinion through which we have passed the animation of
            discussions and of exertions has sometimes worn an aspect which might impose on strangers
            unused to think freely and to speak and to write what they think; but this being now
            decided by the voice of the nation, announced according to the rules of the Constitution,
            all will, of course, <value type = "unity">arrange themselves under the will of the law, and unite in common
            efforts for the common good</value>. All, too, will bear in mind this sacred principle, that
            <value type = "democracy">though the will of the majority</value> is in all cases to prevail, that will to be rightful must
            be reasonable; <value type = "equality">that the minority possess their equal rights, which equal law must
            protect, and to violate would be oppression</value>. Let us, then, fellow-citizens, unite with
            one heart and one mind. Let us restore to social intercourse that harmony and affection
            without which liberty and even life itself are but dreary things. And let us reflect
            that, having banished from our land that religious intolerance under which mankind so
            long bled and suffered, we have yet gained little if we countenance a political
            intolerance as despotic, as wicked, and capable of as bitter and bloody persecutions.
            <tone rhetoric = "appeal to history">During the throes and convulsions of the ancient world, during the agonizing spasms of
            infuriated man, seeking through blood and slaughter his long-lost liberty, it was not
            wonderful that the agitation of the billows should reach even this distant and peaceful
            shore;</tone> that this should be more felt and feared by some and less by others, and should
            divide opinions as to measures of safety. But every difference of opinion is not a
            difference of principle. We have called by different names brethren of the same
            principle. <value type = "unity">We are all Republicans, we are all Federalists</value>. If there be any among us who
            would wish to dissolve this Union or to change its republican form, let them stand
            undisturbed as monuments ofthe safety with which error of opinion may be tolerated where
            reason is left free to combat it. I know, indeed, that some honest men fear that a
            republican government cannot be strong, that this Government is not strong enough; but
            would the honest patriot, in the full tide of successful experiment, abandon a government
            which has so far kept us free and firm on the theoretic and visionary fear that this
            Government, the world's best hope, may by possibility want energy to preserve itself? I
            trust not. <value type = "patriotism">I believe this, on the contrary, the strongest Government on earth</value>. I believe
            it the only one where every man, at the call of the law, would fly to the standard of the
            law, and would meet invasions of the public order as his own personal concern. Sometimes
            it is said that man can not be trusted with the government of himself. Can he, then, be
            trusted with the government of others? Or have we found angels in the forms of kings to
            govern him?</p>
        
        <p>Let history answer this question. Let us, then, with courage and confidence pursue our own
            <value type = "unity">Federal and Republican principles, our attachment to union and representative government</value>.
            Kindly separated by nature and a wide ocean from the exterminating havoc of one quarter
            of the globe; <tone emotion = "pretentious">too high-minded to endure the degradations of the others</tone>; possessing a
            chosen country, with room enough for our descendants to the thousandth and thousandth
            generation; entertaining a due sense of our equal right to the use of our own faculties,
            to the acquisitions of our own industry, to honor and confidence from
            our fellow-citizens, resulting not from birth, but from our actions and their sense of
            them; <value type = "religion">enlightened by a benign religion</value>, professed, indeed, and practiced in various
            forms, ye tall of them inculcating honesty, truth, temperance, gratitude, and the love
            ofman; <value type="religion"> acknowledging and adoring
                an overruling</value> <value type="religion">Providence</value> , which by all <value type="religion"
                    >Its</value> dispensations proves that <value type="religion">It</value> delights in
                the happiness of man here and his greater happiness hereafter—with all
            these blessings, what more is necessary to make us a happy and a prosperous people? Still
            one thing more, fellow-citizens—a wise and frugal Government, which shall restrain men
            from injuring one another, <policy civil_rights = "bill of rights">shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits
                of industry and improvement</policy>, and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it
            has earned. This is the sum of good government, and this is necessary to close the circle
            ofour felicities. </p>
        
        <p>About to enter, fellow-citizens, on the exercise of duties which comprehend
            everything dear and valuable to you, it is proper you should understand what I deem the
            essential principles of our Government, and consequently those which ought to shape
            its Administration. I will compress them within the narrowest compass they will
            bear, stating the general principle, but not all its limitations.Equal and exact justice
            to all men, of whatever state or persuasion, religious or political; peace, commerce,
            and honest friendship with all nations, entangling alliances with none; the support of
            the State governments in all their rights, as the most competent administrations for
            our domestic concerns and the surest bulwarks against antirepublican tendencies;
            the preservation of the General Government in its whole constitutional vigor, as the
            sheet anchor of our peace at home and safety abroad; a jealous care of the right of
            election by the people—a mild and safe corrective of abuses which are lopped by the sword
            of revolution where peaceable remedies are unprovided; absolute acquiescence in
            the decisions of the majority, the vital principle of republics, from which is no appeal
            but to force, the vital principle and immediate parent of despotism;<policy military = "pro">a well
            disciplined militia</policy>, our best reliance in peace and for the first moments of war, till
            regulars may relieve them; the supremacy of the civil over the military authority;
            economy in the public expense, that labor may be lightly burthened; <policy economy = "debt">the honest payment of
            our debts</policy> and sacred preservation of the public faith; encouragement of agriculture, and
            of commerce as its handmaid; the diffusion of information and arraignment of all abuses
            at the bar of the public reason; <policy civil_rights = "bill of rights">freedom of religion; freedom of the press, and freedom
            of person under the protection of the habeas corpus, and trial by juries impartially
            selected</policy>. These principles form the bright constellation which has gone before us and
            guided our steps through an age of revolution and reformation. <tone rhetoric = "appeal to history">The wisdom of our sages
            and blood of our heroes have been devoted to their attainment</tone>. They should be the creed
            of our political faith, the text of civic instruction, the touchstone by which to try
            the services of those we trust; and should we wander from them in moments of error or
            of alarm, let us hasten to retrace our steps and to regain the road which alone leads
            to peace, liberty, and safety.</p> 
        
        <p> I repair, then, fellow-citizens, to the post you
            have assigned me. With experience enough in subordinate offices to have seen the
            difficulties of this the greatest of all, I have learnt to expect that it will rarely
            fall to the lot of imperfect man to retire from this station with the reputation and the
            favor which bring him into it. Without pretensions to that high confidence you reposed in
            our first and greatest revolutionary character, whose preeminent services had entitled
            him to the first place in his country's love and destined for him the fairest page in the
            volume of faithful history, <value type ="humility">I ask so much confidence only as may give firmness and effect
            to the legal administration of your affairs. I shall often go wrong through defect of
            judgment. When right, I shall often be thought wrong by those whose positions will not
            command a view of the whole ground. I ask your indulgence for my own errors, which will
            never be intentional, and your support against the errors of others, who may condemn what
            they would not if seen in all its parts</value>. The approbation implied by your suffrage is a
            great consolation to me for the past, and my future solicitude will be to retain the
            good opinion of those who have bestowed it in advance, to conciliate that of others by
            doing them all the good in my power, and to be instrumental to the happiness and freedom
            of all. Relying, then, on the patronage of your good will, I advance with obedience
            to the work, ready to retire from it whenever you become sensible how much better choice
            itis in your power to make. And
                maythat <value type="religion">Infinite Power</value> which rules the destinies of
                theuniverse lead our councils to what is best, and give them a favorable issue for
                yourpeace and prosperity.</p>
