        <p>Chief Justice Roberts, Vice President Harris, Speaker Pelosi, Leader Schumer, Leader
            McConnell, Vice President Pence, distinguished guests, and my fellow Americans.</p>
        <p><tone emotion="triumph">This is America’s day</tone>. <value type="democracy">This is
                democracy’s day</value>. <tone emotion="optimistic">A day of history and hope. Of
                renewal and resolve.</tone>
            <tone emotion="hope">Through a crucible for the ages America has been tested anew and
                America has risen to the challenge</tone>.</p>
        <p>
            <value type="democracy">Today, we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate, but of a
                cause, the cause of democracy</value>.<tone emotion="triumph">The will of the people
                has been heard and the will of the people has been heeded</tone>. <tone
                emotion="stress">We have learned again that democracy is precious. Democracy is
                fragile.</tone>
            <tone emotion="triumph">And at this hour, my friends, democracy has
            prevailed</tone>.</p>
        <p>So now, <tone emotion="stress">on this hallowed ground where just days ago violence
                sought to shake this Capitol’s very foundation,</tone>
            <value type="unity">we come together as one nation</value>, <value type="religion">under
                God,</value> indivisible, <tone rhetoric="appeal_to_past"> carry out the peaceful
                transfer of power as we have for more than two centuries.</tone>
            <tone emotion="hope">We look ahead in our uniquely American way – restless, bold,
                optimistic – and set our sights on the nation we know we can be and we must
                be</tone>.</p>
        <p>I thank my predecessors of both parties for their presence here. I thank them from the
            bottom of my heart. <tone emotion="pride">You know the resilience of our Constitution
                and the strength of our nation.</tone> As does President Carter, who I spoke to last
            night but who cannot be with us today, but whom we salute for his lifetime of service. I
            have just taken the sacred oath each of these patriots took — <tone
                rhetoric="appeal to past">an oath first sworn by George Washington.</tone></p>
        <p><value type="unity">But the American story depends not on any one of us, not on some of
                us, but on all of us. On “We the People” who seek a more perfect Union. This is a
                great nation and we are a good people</value>. <tone emotion="optimistic">Over the
                centuries through storm and strife, in peace and in war, we have come so far</tone>.
                <tone emotion="stress">But we still have far to go. We will press forward with speed
                and urgency, for we have much to do in this winter of peril and possibility</tone>.
                <value type="restoration">Much to repair. Much to restore</value>. <tone
                emotion="stress">Much to heal</tone>. <value type="progress">Much to build. And much
                to gain</value>.</p>
        <p><tone emotion="stress">Few periods in our nation’s history have been more challenging or
                difficult than the one we’re in now. A once-in-a-century virus silently stalks the
                country</tone>. <tone emotion="mourning">It’s taken as many lives in one year as
                America lost in all of World War II</tone>. <policy economy="jobs">Millions of jobs
                have been lost. Hundreds of thousands of businesses closed</policy>. <policy
                civil_rights="racial_justice">A cry for racial justice some 400 years in the making
                moves us</policy>. The dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer. <policy
                environment="climate_change">A cry for survival comes from the planet
                itself</policy>. A cry that can’t be any more desperate or any more clear. <policy
                terrorism="domestic">And now, a rise in political extremism, white supremacy,
                domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat</policy>.</p>
        <p>To overcome these challenges – <value type="restoration">to restore the soul and to
                secure the future of America</value> – requires more than words. <value type="unity"
                >It requires that most elusive of things in a democracy: Unity. Unity</value>.</p>
        <p><tone rhetoric="appeal_to_past">In another January in Washington, on New Year’s Day 1863,
                Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. When he put pen to paper, the
                President said, “If my name ever goes down into history it will be for this act and
                my whole soul is in it.” My whole soul is in it</tone>.</p>
        <p>Today, on this January day, my whole soul is in this: <value type="unity">Bringing
                America together. Uniting our people. And uniting our nation. I ask every American
                to join me in this cause. Uniting to fight the common foes we face: Anger,
                resentment, hatred. Extremism, lawlessness, violence. Disease, joblessness,
                hopelessness. With unity we can do great things. Important things. We can right
                wrongs</value>. <policy economy="jobs">We can put people to work in good
                jobs</policy>. <policy education="children">We can teach our children</policy>
            <value type="security">in safe schools</value>. <policy health="public_health">We can
                overcome this deadly virus</policy>. <policy economy="middle_class">We can reward
                work, rebuild the middle class</policy>, <policy health="health_care">and make
                health care secure for all</policy>. <policy civil_rights="racial_justice">We can
                deliver racial justice</policy>. <value type="restoration">We can make America, once
                again</value>, <policy foreign="internationalism">the leading force for good in the
                world</policy>.</p>
        <p><value type="unity">I know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish
                fantasy</value>. <tone emotion="stress">I know the forces that divide us are deep
                and they are real</tone>. But I also know they are not new. Our history has been a
            constant struggle between the <value type="equality">American ideal that we are all
                created equal</value> and the <tone emotion="pessimistic">harsh, ugly reality that
                racism, nativism, fear, and demonization have long torn us apart. The battle is
                perennial. Victory is never assured</tone>.</p>
        <p><tone rhetoric="appeal_to_past">Through the Civil War, the Great Depression, World War,
                9/11, through struggle, sacrifice, and setbacks</tone>, <tone emotion="hope">our
                “better angels” have always prevailed</tone>. <value type="unity">In each of these
                moments, enough of us came together to carry all of us forward. And, we can do so
                now</value>.</p>
        <p><value type="unity">History, faith, and reason show the way, the way of unity. We can see
                each other not as adversaries but as neighbors. We can treat each other with dignity
                and respect. We can join forces, stop the shouting, and lower the
                temperature</value>. For without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury.
            No progress, only exhausting outrage. No nation, only a state of chaos.</p>
        <p><tone emotion="stress">This is our historic moment of crisis and challenge</tone>, and
                <value type="unity">unity is the path forward. And, we must meet this moment as the
                United States of America</value>. If we do that, <tone emotion="optimistic">I
                guarantee you, we will not fail</tone>. <value type="unity">We have never, ever,
                ever failed in America when we have acted together</value>.</p>
        <p>And so today, at this time and in this place, <value type="progress">let us start
                afresh</value>. All of us. <value type="unity">Let us listen to one another. Hear
                one another. See one another. Show respect to one another</value>. Politics need not
            be a raging fire destroying everything in its path. Every disagreement doesn’t have to
            be a cause for total war. And, we must reject a culture in which facts themselves are
            manipulated and even manufactured.</p>
        <p><tone emotion="stress">My fellow Americans, we have to be different than this. America
                has to be better than this. And, I believe America is better than this</tone>. Just
            look around. <tone rhetoric="appeal to past">Here we stand, in the shadow of a Capitol
                dome that was completed amid the Civil War, when the Union itself hung in the
                balance</tone>. Yet <tone emotion="optimistic">we endured and we
                prevailed</tone>.<tone rhetoric="appeal_to_past"> Here we stand looking out to the
                great Mall where Dr. King spoke of his dream. Here we stand, where 108 years ago at
                another inaugural, thousands of protestors tried to block brave women from marching
                for the right to vote</tone>. Today, we mark the swearing-in of the first woman in
            American history elected to national office – Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>
        <p>Don’t tell me things can’t change. Here we stand across the Potomac from Arlington
            National Cemetery, where heroes who gave the last full measure of devotion rest in
            eternal peace. And here we stand, <tone emotion="provoking">just days after a riotous
                mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people, to stop the
                work of our democracy, and to drive us from this sacred ground</tone>. <tone
                emotion="optimistic">That did not happen. It will never happen. Not today. Not
                tomorrow. Not ever</tone>.</p>
        <p>To all those who supported our campaign I am humbled by the faith you have placed in us.
            To all those who did not support us, let me say this: Hear me out as we move forward.
            Take a measure of me and my heart. And if you still disagree, so be it. <value
                type="democracy">That’s democracy. That’s America</value>.</p>
        <p>The right to dissent peaceably, within the guardrails of our Republic, is perhaps our
            nation’s greatest strength. Yet hear me clearly: <value type="unity">Disagreement must
                not lead to disunion</value>. And I pledge this to you: I will be a President for
            all Americans. I will fight as hard for those who did not support me as for those who
            did.</p>
        <p><value type="religion">Many centuries ago, Saint Augustine, a saint of my church, wrote
                that a people was a multitude defined by the common objects of their love</value>.
            What are the common objects we love that define us as Americans? I think I know.
            Opportunity. Security. Liberty. Dignity. Respect. Honor. And, yes, the truth.</p>
        <p><tone emotion="stress">Recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson</tone>.
                <tone emotion="provoking">There is truth and there are lies. Lies told for power and
                for profit</tone>. And each of us has a duty and responsibility, as citizens, as
            Americans, and especially as leaders – leaders who have pledged to honor our
            Constitution and protect our nation — to defend the truth and to defeat the lies.</p>
        <p><tone emotion="stress">I understand that many Americans view the future with some fear
                and trepidation. I understand they worry about their jobs, about taking care of
                their families, about what comes next. I get it</tone>. But the answer is not to
            turn inward, to retreat into competing factions, distrusting those who don’t look like
            you do, or worship the way you do, or don’t get their news from the same sources you
            do.</p>
        <p><value type="unity">We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus
                urban, conservative versus liberal. We can do this if we open our souls instead of
                hardening our hearts. If we show a little tolerance and humility. If we’re willing
                to stand in the other person’s shoes just for a moment</value>. Because here is the
            thing about life: There is no accounting for what fate will deal you. There are some
            days when we need a hand. There are other days when we’re called on to lend one. That is
            how we must be with one another. <tone emotion="optimistic">And, if we are this way, our
                country will be stronger, more prosperous, more ready for the future</tone>.</p>
        <p>My fellow Americans, in the work ahead of us, we will need each other. <tone
                emotion="stress">We will need all our strength to persevere through this dark
                winter. We are entering what may well be the toughest and deadliest period of the
                virus</tone>. <value type="unity">We must set aside the politics and finally face
                this pandemic as one nation</value>.</p>
        <p>I promise you this: as the <value type="religion">Bible says weeping may endure for a
                night but joy cometh in the morning</value>. <tone emotion="optimistic">We will get
                through this, together The world is watching today</tone>.</p>
        <p>So here is my message to those beyond our borders: America has been tested and we have
            come out stronger for it. <policy foreign="internationalism">We will repair our alliances
                and engage with the world once again</policy>. Not to meet yesterday’s challenges,
            but today’s and tomorrow’s. <tone emotion="pride">We will lead not merely by the example
                of our power but by the power of our example</tone>. We will be a strong and trusted
            partner for peace, progress, and security.</p>
        <p>We have been through so much in this nation. And, in my first act as President, <value
                type="religion">I would like to ask you to join me in a moment of silent
                prayer</value> to remember all those we lost this past year to the pandemic. <tone
                emotion="mourning">To those 400,000 fellow Americans – mothers and fathers, husbands
                and wives, sons and daughters, friends, neighbors, and co-workers. We will honor
                them by becoming the people and nation we know we can and should be. Let us say a
                silent prayer for those who lost their lives, for those they left behind, and for
                our country. Amen</tone>.</p>
        <p><tone emotion="stress">This is a time of testing. We face an attack on democracy and on
                truth</tone>. <policy health="public_health">A raging virus</policy>. <value
                type="equality">Growing inequity</value>. <policy civil_rights="racial_justice">The
                sting of systemic racism</policy>. <policy environment="climate_change">A climate in
                crisis</policy>. <policy foreign="internationalism">America’s role in the
            world</policy>. Any one of these would be enough to challenge us in profound ways. But
                <tone emotion="stress">the fact is we face them all at once, presenting this nation
                with the gravest of responsibilities</tone>. <value type="action">Now we must step
                up. All of us</value>.</p>
        <p>It is a time for boldness, <tone emotion="stress">for there is so much to do</tone>. And,
            this is certain. We will be judged, you and I, for how we resolve the cascading crises
            of our era. Will we rise to the occasion? Will we master this rare and difficult hour?
                <tone rhetoric="appeal to future">Will we meet our obligations and pass along a new
                and better world for our children?</tone> I believe we must and <tone
                emotion="optimistic">I believe we will</tone>. And when we do, we will write the
            next chapter in the American story.</p>
        <p>It’s a story that might sound something like a song that means a lot to me. It’s called
            “American Anthem” and there is one verse stands out for me: “<tone
                rhetoric="appeal to past">The work and prayers of centuries have brought us to this
                day</tone> What shall be our legacy? <tone rhetoric="appeal to future">What will our
                children say?</tone>… Let me know in my heart When my days are through America
            America I gave my best to you.”</p>
        <p>Let us add our own work and prayers to the unfolding story of our nation. <tone
                rhetoric="appeal to future">If we do this then when our days are through our
                children and our children’s children will say of us they gave their best</tone>.
            They did their duty. They healed a broken land.</p>
        <p>My fellow Americans, I close today where I began, with a sacred oath. Before <value
                type="religion">God</value> and all of you I give you my word. I will always level
            with you. I will defend the Constitution. <value type="democracy">I will defend our
                democracy</value>. I will defend America. I will give my all in your service
            thinking not of power, but of possibilities. Not of personal interest, but of the public
            good. And together, <tone emotion="optimistic">we shall write an American story of
                hope</tone>, not fear. Of <value type="unity">unity</value>, not division. Of light,
            not darkness. An American story of decency and dignity. Of love and of healing. Of
            greatness and of goodness. May this be the story that guides us. The story that inspires
            us. The story that tells ages yet to come that we answered the call of history.</p>
        <p>We met the moment. <value type="democracy">That democracy and hope</value>, truth and
            justice, did not die on our watch but thrived. <value type="liberty">That our America
                secured liberty at home</value> and stood once again as a beacon to the world. That
            is what we owe our forebearers, one another, and generations to follow. So, with purpose
            and resolve we turn to the tasks of our time. Sustained by <value type="religion"
                >faith</value>. Driven by conviction. And, <value type="unity">devoted to one
                another</value> and to this <value type="patriotism">country we love with all our
                hearts</value>.</p>
        <p>May <value type="religion">God bless America</value> and may <policy military="soldiers"
