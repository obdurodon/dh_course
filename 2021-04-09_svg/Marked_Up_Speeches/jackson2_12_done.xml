    <body>
        <p>The will of the American people, expressed through their unsolicited suffrages, calls me
            before you to pass through the solemnities preparatory to taking upon myself the duties
            of President of the United States for another term. For their approbation of my public
            conduct <tone emotion = "stressed">through a period which has not been without its difficulties</tone>, and for this
            renewed expression of their confidence in my good intentions, I am at a loss for terms
            adequate to the <tone emotion = "humble">expression of my gratitude</tone>. It shall be displayed to the extent of my
            humble abilities in continued efforts so to administer the Government as to preserve
            their liberty and promote their happiness.</p>

        <p>So many events have occurred within the last four years which have necessarily called
            forth—sometimes under circumstances the most delicate and painful—my views of the
            principles and policy which ought to be pursued by the General Government that I need on
            this occasion but allude to a few leading considerations connected with some of them. </p>
        <p>The foreign policy adopted by our Government soon after the formation of our present
            Constitution, and very generally pursued by successive Administrations, has been crowned
            with almost complete success, and has elevated our character <tone emotion = "pride">among the nations of the
                earth</tone>. To do justice to all and to submit to wrong from none has been during my
            Administration its governing maxim, and so happy have been its results that we are not
            only at peace with all the world, but have few causes of controversy, and those of minor
            importance, remaining unadjusted.</p>

        <p>In the domestic policy of this Government there are two objects which especially deserve
            the attention of the people and their representatives, and which have been and will
            continue to be the subjects of my increasing solicitude. They are the preservation of
            the rights of the several States and the integrity of the Union. </p>
        
        <p>These great objects are necessarily connected, and can only be attained by an enlightened
            exercise of the powers of each within its appropriate sphere in conformity with the
            public will constitutionally expressed. <policy government = "constitution">To this end it becomes the duty of all to yield
            a ready and patriotic submission to the laws constitutionally enacted, and thereby
            promote and strengthen a proper confidence in those institutions of the several States
            and of the United States which the people themselves have ordained for their own
            government</policy>.</p>

        <p>My experience in public concerns and the observation of a life somewhat advanced confirm
            the opinions long since imbibed by me, that the <policy government = "states_rights">destruction of our State governments or
            the annihilation of their control over the local concerns of the people would lead
            directly to revolution and anarchy, and finally to despotism and military domination</policy>. In
            proportion, therefore, as the General Government encroaches upon the rights of the
            States, in the same proportion does it impair its own power and detract from its ability
            to fulfill the purposes of its creation. Solemnly impressed with these considerations,
            my countrymen will ever find me ready to exercise my constitutional powers in arresting
            measures which may directly or indirectly encroach upon the rights of the States or tend
            to consolidate all political power in the General Government. But of equal, and, indeed,
            of incalculable, <value type = "unity">importance is the union of these States</value>, and the sacred duty of all to
            contribute to its preservation by a liberal support of the General Government in the
            exercise of its just powers. You have been wisely admonished to “accustom yourselves to
            think and speak of the Union as of the palladium of your political safety and
            prosperity, watching for its preservation with jealous anxiety, discountenancing
            whatever may suggest even a suspicion that it can in any event be abandoned, and
            indignantly frowning upon the first dawning of any attempt to alienate any portion of
            our country from the rest or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together the
            various parts.” <value type = "unity">Without union our independence and liberty would never have been
            achieved; without union they never can be maintained</value>. Divided into twenty-four, or even
            a smaller number, of separate communities, we shall see our internal trade burdened with
            numberless restraints and exactions; communication between distant points and sections
            obstructed or cut off, our sons made soldiers to deluge with blood the fields they now
            till in peace; the mass of our people borne down and impoverished by taxes to support
            armies and navies, and military leaders at the head of their victorious legions becoming
            our lawgivers and judges. The loss of liberty, of all good government, of peace, plenty,
            and happiness, must inevitably follow a dissolution of the Union. In supporting it,
            therefore, we support all that is dear to the freeman and the philanthropist. </p>
        
        <p>The time at which I stand before you is full of interest. The eyes of all nations are
            fixed on our Republic. <tone emotion = "stressed">The event of the existing crisis</tone> will be decisive in the opinion
            of mankind of the practicability of our federal system of government. Great is the stake
            placed in our hands; great is the responsibility which must rest upon the people of the
            United States. Let us realize the importance of the attitude in which we stand before
            the world. Let us exercise forbearance and firmness. Let us extricate our country from
            the dangers which surround it and learn wisdom from the lessons they inculcate.</p>

        <p>Deeply impressed with the truth of these observations, and under the obligation of that
            solemn oath which I am about to take, I shall continue to exert all my faculties to
            maintain the just powers of the Constitution and to transmit unimpaired to posterity the
            blessings of our Federal Union. At the same time, it will be my aim to inculcate by my
            official acts the necessity of exercising by the <policy government = "balance_of_power">General Government those powers only
            that are clearly delegated; to encourage simplicity and economy in the expenditures of
            the Government</policy>; to raise no more money from the people than may be requisite for these
            objects, and in a manner that will best promote the interests of all classes of the
            community and of all portions of the Union. Constantly bearing in mind that in entering
            into society “individuals must give up a share of liberty to preserve the rest,” it will
            be my desire so to discharge my duties as to foster with our brethren in all parts of
            the country a spirit of liberal concession and compromise, and, by reconciling our
            fellow-citizens to those partial sacrifices which they must unavoidably make for the
            preservation of a greater good, to recommend our invaluable Government and Union to the
            confidence and affections of the American people. </p>
        <p>
            Finally, it is my most fervent prayer
                to that <value type = "religion">Almighty Being</value> before whom I now stand, and who
                has kept us in <value type = "religion">His</value> hands from the infancy of our Republic
                to the present day, that <value type = "religion">He</value> will so overrule all my
            intentions and actions and inspire the hearts of my <value type = "unity">fellow-citizens</value> that we may be
                preserved from dangers of all kinds and continue forever a united and happy
                people.
        </p>
