        <p>Mr. Vice President, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chief Justice, Senator Cook, Mrs. Eisenhower, and my
            fellow citizens of <tone emotion="pride">this great and good country we share
                together:</tone></p>
        <p>When we met here four years ago, America was bleak in spirit, depressed by the prospect
            of seemingly endless war abroad and of destructive conflict at home. As we meet here
            today, we stand on the threshold of a new era of peace in the world. The central
            question before us is: How shall we use that peace?</p>

        <p><policy foreign="internationalism">Let us resolve that this era we are about to enter
                will not be what other postwar periods have so often been: a time of retreat and
                isolation that leads to stagnation at home and invites new danger abroad</policy>.
            Let us resolve that this will be what it can become: a time of great responsibilities
            greatly borne, in which we renew the spirit and the promise of America as we enter our
            third century as a nation.</p>

        <p>This past year saw far-reaching results from our new policies for peace. <policy
                foreign="internationalism">By continuing to revitalize our traditional friendships,
                and by our missions to Peking and to Moscow, we were able to establish the base for
                a new and more durable pattern of relationships among the nations of the
                world</policy>.<tone emotion="optimistic">Because of America’s bold initiatives,
                1972 will be long remembered as the year of the greatest progress since the end of
                World War II toward a lasting peace in the world</tone>.</p>

        <p>The peace we seek in the world is not the flimsy peace which is merely an interlude
            between wars, <tone rhetoric="appeal_to_future">but a peace which can endure for
                generations to come</tone>.</p>

        <p>It is important that we understand both the necessity and the limitations of America’s
            role in maintaining that peace. <value type="action">Unless we in America work to
                preserve the peace, there will be no peace</value>. <value type="liberty">Unless we
                in America work to preserve freedom, there will be no freedom</value>.</p>

        <p>But let us clearly understand the new nature of America’s role, as a result of the new
            policies we have adopted over these past four years.</p>

        <p><policy foreign="internationalism">We shall respect our treaty commitments. We shall
                support vigorously the principle that no country has the right to impose its will or
                rule on another by force. We shall continue, in this era of negotiation, to work for
                the limitation of nuclear arms, and to reduce the danger of confrontation between
                the great powers. We shall do our share in defending peace and freedom in the world.
                But we shall expect others to do their share</policy>.</p>

        <p><policy foreign="internationalism">The time has passed when America will make every other
                nation’s conflict our own, or make every other nation’s future our responsibility,
                or presume to tell the people of other nations how to manage their own affairs. Just
                as we respect the right of each nation to determine its own future, we also
                recognize the responsibility of each nation to secure its own future</policy>. Just
            as America’s role is indispensable in preserving the world’s peace, so is each nation’s
            role indispensable in preserving its own peace.</p>

        <p><policy foreign="internationalism">Together with the rest of the world, let us resolve to
                move forward from the beginnings we have made. Let us continue to bring down the
                walls of hostility which have divided the world for too long, and to build in their
                place bridges of understanding—so that despite profound differences between systems
                of government, the people of the world can be friends</policy>.</p>

        <p><policy foreign="internationalism">Let us build a structure of peace in the
                world</policy><value type="equality">in which the weak are as safe as the strong—in
                which each respects the right of the other to live by a different system</value>—in
            which those who would influence others will do so by the strength of their ideas, and
            not by the force of their arms.</p>

        <p>Let us accept that high responsibility not as a burden, but gladly—gladly because the
            chance <tone emotion="pride">to build such a peace is the noblest endeavor in which a
                nation can engage; gladly</tone>, also, because only if we act greatly in meeting
            our responsibilities abroad will we remain a great Nation, and only if we remain a great
            Nation will we act greatly in meeting our challenges at home.</p>

        <p>We have the chance today to do more than ever before in our history to make life better
            in America—<policy education="general">to ensure better education</policy>, <policy
                health="general">better health</policy>, better housing, better transportation, a
                <policy environment="preservation">cleaner environment</policy>—<policy
                crime="saftey">to restore respect for law, to make our communities more
                livable</policy>—<value type="religion">and to insure the God-given
                right</value><value type="equality">of every American to full and equal
                opportunity</value>. Because the range of our needs is so great—because the reach of
            our opportunities is so great—let us be bold in our determination to meet those needs in
            new ways.</p>

        <p>Just as building a structure of peace abroad has required turning away from old policies
            that failed, <value type="progress">so building a new era of progress at home requires
                turning away from old policies that have failed</value>.</p>

        <p>Abroad, the shift from old policies to new has not been a retreat from our
            responsibilities, but a better way to peace. <value type="progress">And at home, the
                shift from old policies to new will not be a retreat from our responsibilities, but
                a better way to progress</value>. Abroad and at home, the key to those new
            responsibilities lies in the placing and the division of responsibility. We have lived
            too long with the consequences of attempting to gather all power and responsibility in
            Washington. Abroad and at home, the time has come to turn away from the condescending
            policies of paternalism—of “Washington knows best.”</p>

        <p>A person can be expected to act responsibly only if he has responsibility. This is human
            nature. So let us encourage individuals at home and nations abroad to do more for
            themselves, to decide more for themselves. Let us locate responsibility in more places.
            Let us measure what we will do for others by what they will do for themselves.</p>

        <p><policy government="small_government">That is why today I offer no promise of a purely
                governmental solution for every problem. We have lived too long with that false
                promise. In trusting too much in government, we have asked of it more than it can
                deliver</policy>. This leads only to inflated expectations, to reduced individual
            effort, and to a disappointment and frustration that erode confidence both in what
            government can do and in what people can do.</p>

        <p><policy government="small_government">Government must learn to take less from people so
                that people can do more for themselves. Let us remember that America was built not
                by government, but by people—not by welfare, but by work—not by shirking
                responsibility, but by seeking responsibility. In our own lives, let each of us
                ask—not just what will government do for me, but what can I do for myself? In the
                challenges we face together, let each of us ask—not just how can government help,
                but how can I help</policy>?</p>

        <p>Your National Government has a great and vital role to play. And I pledge to you that
            where this Government should act, we will act boldly and we will lead boldly. But just
            as important is the role that each and every one of us must play, as an individual and
            as a member of his own community.</p>

        <p>From this day forward, let each of us make a solemn commitment in his own heart: to bear
            his responsibility, to do his part, to live his ideals—so that together, <value
                type="progress">we can see the dawn of a new age of progress for America</value>,
            and <tone emotion="pride">together, as we celebrate our 200th anniversary as a nation,
                we can do so proud in the fulfillment of our promise to ourselves and to the
                world</tone>.</p>

        <p>As America’s longest and most difficult war comes to an end, <value type="unity">let us
                again learn to debate our differences with civility and decency. And let each of us
                reach out for that one precious quality government cannot provide—a new level of
                respect for the rights and feelings of one another</value>, a new level of respect
            for the individual human dignity which is the cherished birthright of every American.
            Above all else, the time has come for us to renew our faith in ourselves and in
            America.</p>

        <p>In recent years, that faith has been challenged. <tone emotion="provoking">Our children
                have been taught to be ashamed of their country, ashamed of their parents, ashamed
                of America’s record at home and of its role in the world</tone>.</p>

        <p><tone emotion="optimistic">At every turn, we have been beset by those who find everything
                wrong with America and little that is right. But I am confident that this will not
                be the judgment of history on these remarkable times in which we are privileged to
                live</tone>. <tone emotion="pride">America’s record in this century has been
                unparalleled in the world’s history for its responsibility, for its generosity, for
                its creativity and for its progress</tone>. <value type="democracy">Let us be proud
                that our system has produced and provided more freedom and more abundance, more
                widely shared, than any other system in the history of the world</value>.</p>

        <p>Let us be proud that in each of the four wars in which we have been engaged in this
            century, including the one we are now bringing to an end, we have fought not for our
            selfish advantage, but to help others resist aggression. Let us be proud that by our
            bold, new initiatives, and by our steadfastness for peace with honor, <tone
                rhetoric="appeal_to_future">we have made a break-through toward creating in the
                world what the world has not known before—a structure of peace that can last, not
                merely for our time, but for generations to come</tone>. We are embarking here today
            on an era that presents challenges great as those any nation, or any generation, has
            ever faced.</p>

        <p><value type="religion">We shall answer to God</value>, to history, and to our conscience
            for the way in which we use these years. <tone rhetoric="appeal_to_past">As I stand in
                this place, so hallowed by history, I think of others who have stood here before me.
                I think of the dreams they had for America</tone>, and I think of how each
            recognized that he needed help far beyond himself in order to make those dreams come
            true.</p>

        <p><value type="religion">Today, I ask your prayers that in the years ahead I may have God’s
                help in making decisions that are right for America</value>, and I pray for your
            help so that together we may be worthy of our challenge. Let us pledge together to make
            these next four years the best four years in America’s history, so that on its 200th
            birthday America will be as young and as vital as when it began, and as bright a beacon
            of hope for all the world.</p>

        <p><value type="religion">Let us go forward from here confident in hope, strong in our faith
                in one another, sustained by our faith in God who created us, and striving always to
                serve His purpose</value>. </p>
