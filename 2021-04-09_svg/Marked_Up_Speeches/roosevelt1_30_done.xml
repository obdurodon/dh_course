    <body>
        <p><tone emotion="proud">My fellow-citizens, no people on earth have more cause to be thankful
                than ours,</tone> and this is said reverently, in no spirit of boastfulness in our
            own strength, <value type="religion">but with gratitude to the Giver of Good who has
                blessed us with the conditions which have enabled us to achieve so large a measure
                of well-being and of happiness.</value> To us as a people it has been granted to
            lay the foundations of our national life in a new continent. We are the heirs of the
            ages, and yet we have had to pay few of the penalties which in old countries are exacted
            by the dead hand of a bygone civilization. We have not been obliged to fight for our
            existence against any alien race; <value type="action">and yet our life has called
                for the vigor and effort without which the manlier and hardier virtues wither
                away.</value><value type="action"> Under such conditions it would
                be our own fault if we failed; and the success which we have had in the past, the
                success which we confidently believe the future will bring,</value> should cause in
            us no feeling of vainglory, but rather a deep and abiding realization of all which life
            has offered us; a full acknowledgment of the responsibility which is ours;<tone
                emotion="optimistic"> and a fixed determination to show that under a free government a
                mighty people can thrive best,</tone> alike as regards the things of the body <value type="religion">and the
                    things of the soul.</value>
        </p>
        <p><tone emotion="proud">Much has been given us, and much will rightfully be
                expected from us. We have duties to others and duties to ourselves; and we can shirk
                neither. We have become a great nation, forced by the fact of its greatness into
                relations with the other nations of the earth, and we must behave as beseems a
                people with such responsibilities.</tone>
            <policy foreign="cooperation">Toward all other nations, large and small, our attitude
                must be one of cordial and sincere friendship.</policy> We must show not only in our
            words, but in our deeds, that we are earnestly desirous of securing their good will by
            acting toward them in a spirit of just and generous recognition of all their rights. But
            justice and generosity in a nation, as in an individual, count most when shown not by
            the weak but by the strong. <tone emotion="stern">While ever careful to refrain from
                wrongdoing others, we must be no less insistent that we are not wronged
                ourselves.</tone> We wish peace, but we wish the peace of justice, the peace of
            righteousness. We wish it because we think it is right and not because we are afraid.
                <tone emotion="stern"> No weak nation that acts manfully and justly should ever
                have cause to fear us, and no strong power should ever be able to single us out as a
                subject for insolent aggression.</tone></p>

        <p>Our relations with the other powers of the world are important; but still more important
            are our relations among ourselves. Such growth in wealth, in population, and in power as
            this nation has seen during the century and a quarter of its national life is inevitably
            accompanied by a like growth in the problems which are ever before every nation that
            rises to greatness. Power invariably means both responsibility and danger. Our
            forefathers faced certain perils which we have outgrown. We now face other perils, the
            very existence of which it was impossible that they should foresee. Modern life is both
            complex and intense, and the tremendous changes wrought by the extraordinary industrial
            development of the last half century are felt in every fiber of our social and political
            being. <value type="democracy">Never before have men tried so vast and formidable an experiment as that of
                administering the affairs of a continent under the forms of a Democratic republic.</value> The
            conditions which have told for our marvelous material well-being, which have developed
            to a very high degree <value type="action">our energy,</value><value
                type="individualism"> self-reliance, and individual initiative,</value>
            have also brought the care and anxiety inseparable from the accumulation of great wealth
            in industrial centers. Upon the success of our experiment much depends, not only as
            regards our own welfare, but as regards the welfare of mankind. If we fail, the cause of
                <value type="democracy">free self-government throughout the world will rock to its
                foundations, and therefore our responsibility is heavy, to ourselves, to the world
                as it is today,</value> <tone rhetoric="appeal_to_future">and to the generations yet unborn.</tone> There is no good reason
            why we should fear the future, <tone emotion="stern">but there is every reason why we should face it
            seriously, neither hiding from ourselves the gravity of the problems before us nor
            fearing to approach these problems with the unbending, unflinching purpose to solve them
            aright.</tone></p>

        <p>Yet, after all, though the problems are new, though the tasks set before us differ from
            the tasks set before our fathers who founded and preserved this Republic, the spirit in
            which these tasks must be undertaken and these problems faced, if our duty is to be well
            done, remains essentially unchanged. <value type="democracy">We know that
                self-government is difficult.</value> We know that no people needs such high traits
            of character as that people which seeks to govern its affairs aright through the freely
            expressed will of the freemen who compose it. <tone rhetoric="appeal_to_history">But we have faith that we shall not prove
            false to the memories of the men of the mighty past. They did their work, they left us
            the splendid heritage we now enjoy.</tone> We in our turn have an assured <tone
                emotion="confident">confidence that we shall be able to leave this heritage
                unwasted</tone> and <tone rhetoric="appeal_to_future">enlarged to our children
                and our childrenâ€™s children.</tone> To so we must show, not merely in great
            crises, but in the everyday affairs of life, the qualities of practical intelligence, of
            courage, of hardihood, and endurance, and above all the power of devotion to a lofty
            ideal, <tone rhetoric="appeal_to_past"> which made great the men who founded this
                Republic in the days of Washington, which made great the men who preserved this
                Republic in the days of Abraham Lincoln.</tone></p>
