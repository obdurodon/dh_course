        <p>Senator Dirksen, Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Vice President, President Johnson, Vice President
            Humphrey, my fellow Americans—and my fellow citizens of the world community:</p>

        <p><tone emotion="triumph">I ask you to share with me today the majesty of this
                moment</tone>. <value type="unity">In the orderly transfer of power, we celebrate
                the unity that keeps us free</value>.</p>

        <p>Each moment in history is a fleeting time, precious and unique. But some stand out as
            moments of beginning, in which courses are set that shape decades or centuries. This can
            be such a moment.</p>

        <p>Forces now are converging that make possible, <tone emotion="optimistic">for the first
                time, the hope that many of man’s deepest aspirations can at last be
            realized</tone>. The spiraling pace of change allows us to contemplate, within our own
            lifetime, advances that once would have taken centuries.</p>

        <p>In throwing wide the horizons of space, we have discovered new horizons on earth. For the
            first time, because the people of the world want peace, and the leaders of the world are
            afraid of war, the times are on the side of peace.</p>

        <p>Eight years from now America will celebrate its 200th anniversary as a nation. Within the
            lifetime of most people now living, mankind will celebrate that great new year which
            comes only once in a thousand years—the beginning of the third millennium. What kind of
            nation we will be, what kind of world we will live in, whether we shape the future in
            the image of our hopes, is ours to determine by our actions and our choices.</p>

        <p><policy foreign="internationalism">The greatest honor history can bestow is the title of
                peacemaker. This honor now beckons America—the chance to help lead the world at last
                out of the valley of turmoil</policy>, and onto that high ground of peace that man
            has dreamed of since the dawn of civilization.</p>

        <p>If we succeed, <tone rhetoric="appeal_to_future">generations to come will say of us now
                living that we mastered our moment</tone>, that we helped make the world safe for
            mankind. This is our summons to greatness. I believe the American people are ready to
            answer this call.</p>

        <p><tone emotion="pride">The second third of this century has been a time of proud
                achievement</tone>. <value type="science">We have made enormous strides in
                science</value> and industry and agriculture. We have shared our wealth more broadly
            than ever. <policy economy="general">We have learned at last to manage a modern economy
                to assure its continued growth</policy>. <value type="liberty">We have given freedom
                new reach</value>, <policy civil_rights="race">and we have begun to make its promise
                real for black as well as for white</policy>.</p>

        <p><tone rhetoric="appeal_to_future">We see the hope of tomorrow in the youth of today. I
                know America’s youth. I believe in them</tone>. We can be proud that they are better
            educated, more committed, more passionately driven by conscience than any generation in
            our history.</p>

        <p><tone emotion="pride">No people has ever been so close to the achievement of a just and
                abundant society, or so possessed of the will to achieve it</tone>. Because our
            strengths are so great, we can afford to appraise our weaknesses with candor and to
            approach them with hope.</p>

        <p><tone rhetoric="appeal_to_past">Standing in this same place a third of a century ago,
                Franklin Delano Roosevelt addressed a Nation ravaged by depression and gripped in
                fear</tone>. He could say in surveying the Nation’s troubles: “<value
                type="religion">They concern, thank God, only material things</value>.” <tone
                emotion="stress">Our crisis today is the reverse</tone>. We have found ourselves
            rich in goods, but ragged in spirit; reaching with magnificent precision for the moon,
            but falling into raucous discord on earth.</p>

        <p>We are caught in war, wanting peace. <value type="unity">We are torn by division, wanting
                unity</value>. We see around us empty lives, wanting fulfillment. <value
                type="action">We see tasks that need doing, waiting for hands to do them</value>. To
            a crisis of the spirit, we need an answer of the spirit. To find that answer, we need
            only look within ourselves. When we listen to “the better angels of our nature,” we find
            that they celebrate the simple things, the basic things—such as goodness, decency, love,
            kindness.</p>

        <p>Greatness comes in simple trappings. <value type="unity">The simple things are the ones
                most needed today if we are to surmount what divides us, and cement what unites us.
                To lower our voices would be a simple thing</value>.</p>

        <p><tone emotion="stress">In these difficult years, America has suffered from a fever of
                words; from inflated rhetoric that promises more than it can deliver; from angry
                rhetoric that fans discontents into hatreds; from bombastic rhetoric that postures
                instead of persuading</tone>. We cannot learn from one another until we stop
            shouting at one another—until we speak quietly enough so that our words can be heard as
            well as our voices.</p>

        <p>For its part, government will listen. We will strive to listen in new ways—to the voices
            of quiet anguish, the voices that speak without words, the voices of the heart—to the
            injured voices, the anxious voices, the voices that have despaired of being heard.
                <value type="equality">Those who have been left out, we will try to bring in. Those
                left behind, we will help to catch up</value>. For all of our people, we will set as
            our goal the decent order that makes progress possible and our lives secure.</p>

        <p>As we reach toward our hopes, our task is to build on what has gone before—not turning
            away from the old, but turning toward the new. In this past third of a century,
            government has passed more laws, spent more money, initiated more programs, than in all
            our previous history.</p>

        <p><policy economy="jobs housing">In pursuing our goals of full employment, better
                housing</policy>, <policy education="general">excellence in education</policy>; in
            rebuilding our cities and improving our rural areas; <policy environment="preservation"
                >in protecting our environment</policy> and enhancing the quality of life—in all
            these and more, we will and must press urgently forward. <policy military="peace">We
                shall plan now for the day when our wealth can be transferred from the destruction
                of war abroad to the urgent needs of our people at home</policy>. <value
                type="action">The American dream does not come to those who fall asleep</value>.</p>

        <p><policy government="self_government">But we are approaching the limits of what government
                alone can do. Our greatest need now is to reach beyond government, and to enlist the
                legions of the concerned and the committed</policy>.</p>

        <p>What has to be done, has to be done by government and people together or it will not be
            done at all. The lesson of past agony is that without the people we can do nothing; with
            the people we can do everything.</p>

        <p>To match the magnitude of our tasks, we need the energies of our people—enlisted not only
            in grand enterprises, but more importantly in those small, splendid efforts that make
            headlines in the neighborhood newspaper instead of the national journal.</p>

        <p>With these, <value type="religion">we can build a great cathedral of the
                spirit</value>—<value type="unity">each of us raising it one stone at a time, as he
                reaches out to his neighbor, helping, caring, doing</value>.</p>

        <p>I do not offer a life of uninspiring ease. I do not call for a life of grim sacrifice. I
            ask you to join in a high adventure—one as rich as humanity itself, and as exciting as
            the times we live in. <value type="liberty">The essence of freedom is that each of us
                shares in the shaping of his own destiny</value>.</p>

        <p>Until he has been part of a cause larger than himself, no man is truly whole. The way to
            fulfillment is in the use of our talents; we achieve nobility in the spirit that
            inspires that use.</p>

        <p>As we measure what can be done, we shall promise only what we know we can produce, but as
            we chart our goals we shall be lifted by our dreams. <value type="equality">No man can
                be fully free while his neighbor is not</value>. <value type="unity">To go forward
                at all is to go forward together</value>.</p>

        <p><policy civil_rights="race">This means black and white together, as one nation, not
                two</policy>. The laws have caught up with our conscience. What remains is to give
            life to what is in the law: <value type="religion">to ensure at last that as all are
                born equal in dignity before God</value>, all are born equal in dignity before man.
                <value type="unity">As we learn to go forward together at home, let us also seek to
                go forward together with all mankind</value>.</p>

        <p><policy military="peace">Let us take as our goal: where peace is unknown, make it
                welcome; where peace is fragile, make it strong; where peace is temporary, make it
                permanent</policy>. <policy foreign="internationalism">After a period of
                confrontation, we are entering an era of negotiation. Let all nations know that
                during this administration our lines of communication will be open</policy>.</p>

        <p><policy foreign="internationalism">We seek an open world—open to ideas, open to the
                exchange of goods and people—a world in which no people, great or small, will live
                in angry isolation. We cannot expect to make everyone our friend, but we can try to
                make no one our enemy</policy>.</p>

        <p><policy foreign="internationalism">Those who would be our adversaries, we invite to a
                peaceful competition—not in conquering territory or extending dominion, but in
                enriching the life of man</policy>.<value type="science">As we explore the reaches
                of space</value>, <policy foreign="internationalism">let us go to the new worlds
                together—not as new worlds to be conquered, but as a new adventure to be
                shared</policy>.</p>

        <p>With those who are willing to join, <policy military="arms peace">let us cooperate to
                reduce the burden of arms, to strengthen the structure of peace</policy>, to lift up
            the poor and the hungry. But to all those who would be tempted by weakness, let us leave
            no doubt that we will be as strong as we need to be for as long as we need to be.</p>

        <p>Over the past twenty years, since I first came to this Capital as a freshman Congressman,
            I have visited most of the nations of the world. I have come to know the leaders of the
            world, and the great forces, the hatreds, the fears that divide the world. <policy
                foreign="internationalism">I know that peace does not come through wishing for
                it—that there is no substitute for days and even years of patient and prolonged
                diplomacy</policy>.</p>

        <p>I also know the people of the world. I have seen the hunger of a homeless child, the pain
            of a man wounded in battle, the grief of a mother who has lost her son. <policy
                civil_rights="race">I know these have no ideology, no race</policy>.</p>

        <p>I know America. I know the heart of America is good. I speak from my own heart, and the
            heart of my country, the deep concern we have for those who suffer, and those who
            sorrow.</p>

        <p><value type="religion">I have taken an oath today in the presence of God and my
                countrymen</value> to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. To
            that oath I now add this sacred commitment: <policy military="peace">I shall consecrate
                my office, my energies, and all the wisdom I can summon, to the cause of peace among
                nations</policy>.</p>

        <p>Let this message be heard by strong and weak alike: <policy military="peace">The peace we
                seek to win is not victory over any other people, but the peace that comes “with
                healing in its wings”; with compassion for those who have suffered; with
                understanding for those who have opposed us; with the opportunity for all the
                peoples of this earth to choose their own destiny</policy>.</p>

        <p> Only a few short weeks ago, <value type="religion">we shared the glory of man’s first
            sight of the world as God sees it</value>, <value type="science">as a single sphere reflecting light in the
                darkness. As the Apollo astronauts flew over the moon’s gray surface on Christmas
                Eve, they spoke to us of the beauty of earth—and in that voice so clear across the
                lunar distance</value>, <value type="religion">we heard them invoke God’s blessing on its goodness</value>.</p>

        <p>In that moment, their view from the moon moved poet Archibald MacLeish to write: “To see
            the earth as it truly is, small and blue and beautiful in that eternal silence where it
            floats, is to see ourselves as riders on the earth together, brothers on that bright
            loveliness in the eternal cold—brothers who know now they are truly brothers.”</p>

        <p><value type="science">In that moment of surpassing technological triumph, men turned their thoughts toward home
            and humanity—seeing in that far perspective that man’s destiny on earth is not
            divisible; telling us that however far we reach into the cosmos, our destiny lies not in
            the stars but on Earth itself, in our own hands, in our own hearts</value>.</p>

        <p>We have endured a long night of the American spirit. But as our eyes catch the dimness of
            the first rays of dawn, let us not curse the remaining dark. Let us gather the
            light.</p>

        <p>Our destiny offers, not the cup of despair, but the chalice of opportunity. So let us seize it, not in fear, but in
                gladness—and, “riders on the earth together,” let us go forward, firm in our faith,
                steadfast in our purpose, cautious of the dangers; <value type="religion">but sustained by our confidence
                    in the will of God and the promise of man</value>.</p>
