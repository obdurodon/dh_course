    <body>
        <p>Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, fellow
            Americans and people of the world – thank you.</p>
        <p>We the citizens of America have now joined a great national effort to <value
                type="restoration">rebuild our county and restore its promise for all our
                people</value>. Together we will determine the course of America for many, many
            years to come. <tone emotion="stress">Together we will face challenges. We will confront
                hardships.</tone>
            <tone emotion="optimistic">But we will get the job done.</tone></p>
        <p>Every four years we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer
            of power. And we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their
            gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent, thank you.</p>
        <p>Today’s ceremony, however, has very special meaning because today we are not merely
            transferring power from one administration to another – <tone emotion="provoking">but
                transferring it from Washington DC and giving it back to you the people. For too
                long a small group in our nation’s capital has reaped the rewards of government
                while the people have borne the cost</tone>. <policy economy="wealth">Washington
                flourished but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered but the
                jobs left and the factories closed. The establishment protected itself but not the
                citizens of our country</policy>.</p>
        <p>
            <tone emotion="provoking">Their victories have not been your victories. Their triumphs
                have not been your triumphs. While they have celebrated there has been little to
                celebrate for struggling families all across our land.</tone>
        </p>
        <p>That all changes starting right here and right now because <tone emotion="triumph">this
                moment is your moment. It belongs to you. It belongs to everyone gathered here today
                and everyone watching all across America today. This is your day. This is your
                celebration.</tone>
            <tone emotion="pride">And this – the United States of America – is your
            country.</tone></p>
        <p>What truly matters is not what party controls our government but that this government is
            controlled by the people. <tone emotion="triumph">Today, January 20 2017, will be
                remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again. The
                forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. Everyone is
                listening to you now. You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic
                movement – the likes of which the world has never seen before</tone>. At the centre
            of this movement is a crucial conviction – that a nation exists to serve its
            citizens.</p>
        <p><policy education="schools">Americans want great schools for their children</policy>,
                <policy crime="safety">safe neighbourhoods for their families</policy> and <policy
                economy="jobs">good jobs for themselves</policy>. These are just and reasonable
            demands <tone emotion="provoking">Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner
                cities</tone>, <policy economy="industry">rusted out factories scattered like
                tombstones across the landscape of our nation</policy>. <policy education="schools"
                >An education system flushed with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful
                students deprived of all knowledge</policy>. <policy crime="drugs">And the crime and
                the gangs and the drugs which deprive people of so much unrealised
                potential</policy>. <value type="unity">We are one nation, and their pain is our
                pain, their dreams are our dreams, we share one nation</value>, <tone
                emotion="pride">one home and one glorious destiny</tone>.</p>
        <p>Today I take an oath of allegiance to all Americans. <policy economy="industry">For many
                decades, we’ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American
                industry</policy>, <policy military="general">subsidised the armies of other
                countries, while allowing the sad depletion of our own military</policy>. <policy
                foreign="isolationism">We've defended other nations’ borders while refusing to
                defend our own. And spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while
                America’s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay. We have made other
                countries rich while the wealth, strength and confidence of our country has
                dissipated over the horizon</policy>. <policy economy="industry">One by one,
                shutters have closed on our factories without even a thought about the millions and
                millions of those who have been left behind</policy>.</p>
        <p><value type="progress">But that is the past and now we are looking only to the
                future</value>. We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in
            every city, in every foreign capital, in every hall of power – from this day on a new
            vision will govern our land – from this day onwards it is only going to be <policy
                foreign="isolationism">America first – America first!</policy></p>
        <p><policy foreign="isolationism">Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on
                foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American
                families.</policy> Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength. <tone
                emotion="optimistic">I will fight for you with every bone in my body and I will
                never ever let you down.</tone>
            <value type="restoration">America will start winning again</value>. <tone
                emotion="optimistic">America will start winning like never before.</tone>
            <policy economy="jobs">We will bring back our jobs</policy>, <policy
                foreign="isolationism">we will bring back our borders,</policy>
            <value type="restoration">we will bring back our wealth, we will bring back our
                dreams.</value> We will bring new roads and high roads and bridges and tunnels and
            railways all across our wonderful nation. <policy welfare="anti_welfare">We will get our
                people off welfare and back to work – rebuilding our country with American hands and
                American labour</policy>. <policy foreign="isolationism">We will follow two simple
                rules – buy American and hire American</policy>.</p>
        <p><policy foreign="isolationism">We see good will with the nations of the world but we do
                so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their nations
                first.</policy>
            <tone emotion="optimistic">We will shine for everyone to follow.</tone>
            <policy foreign="international">We will reinforce old alliances and form new
                ones,</policy> and <policy terrorism="foreign">untie the world against radical
                Islamic terrorism which we will eradicate from the face of the earth</policy>.</p>
        <p><value type="patriotism">At the bed rock of our politics will be an allegiance to the
                United States.</value>
            <value type="unity">And we will discover new allegiance to each other. There is no room
                for prejudice</value>. <value type="religion">The bible tells us how good and
                pleasant it is when god’s people live together in unity</value>. <value type="unity"
                >When America is united, America is totally unstoppable</value>. <policy
                military="protection">There is no fear, we are protected and will always be
                protected by the great men and women of our military</policy> and most importantly
                <value type="religion">we will be protected by god</value>.</p>
        <p>Finally, <value type="progress">we must think big and dream even bigger.</value> As
            Americans, we know we live as a nation only when it is striving. <value type="action">We
                will no longer accept politicians who are always complaining but never doing
                anything about it. The time for empty talk is over, now arrives the hour of action.
                Do not allow anyone to tell you it cannot be done. No challenge can match the heart
                and fight and spirit of America</value>. <tone emotion="optimistic">We will not
                fail, our country will thrive and prosper again.</tone> We stand at the birth of a
            new millennium, ready to <value type="science">unlock the mysteries of space</value>,
                <policy health="public_health">to free the earth from the miseries of
                disease</policy>, <policy economy="industry">to harvest the energies, industries and
                technologies of tomorrow</policy>. <tone emotion="pride">A new national pride will
                stir ourselves</tone>, lift our sights and <value type="unity">heal our
                divisions.</value>
            <value type="patriotism">It’s time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never
                forget, that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood
                of patriots</value>.</p>
        <p><value type="unity">We all enjoy the same glorious freedoms and we all salute the same
                great American flag and whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or
                the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look at the same night sky, and dream the
                same dreams</value>, and they are infused with the breath by the same <value
                type="religion">almighty creator</value>.</p>
        <p>So to all Americans in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to
            mountain, from ocean to ocean – hear these words – <tone emotion="provoking">you will
                never be ignored again</tone>. <tone emotion="inspiring">Your voice, your hopes and
                dreams will define your American destiny. Your courage, goodness and love will
                forever guide us along the way.</tone>
            <value type="restoration">Together we will make America strong again, we will make
                America wealthy again, we will make America safe again and yes – together we will
                make America great again</value>.</p>
        <p>Thank you. <value type="religion">God bless you. And god bless America</value>.</p>
