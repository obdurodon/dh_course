  <body>
    <p>My fellow citizens, I stand here today humbled by the task before us, grateful for the trust
      you bestowed, mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors. I thank President Bush for his
      service to our Nation, as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this
      transition.</p>
    <p>Forty-four Americans have now taken the Presidential oath. The words have been spoken during
      rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace. Yet, every so often, the oath is
      taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms. At these moments, America has carried on not
      simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because we, <tone
        rhetoric="appeal_to_past">the people, have remained faithful to the ideals of our
        forebearers and true to our founding documents</tone>. So it has been. So it must be with
      this generation of Americans.</p>
    <p><tone emotion="stress">That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood</tone>.
        <policy military="war">Our Nation is at war against a far-reaching network of violence and
        hatred</policy>. <policy economy="general">Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of
        greed and irresponsibility on the part of some</policy>, but also our collective failure to
      make hard choices and <value type="progress">prepare the Nation for a new age</value>. <policy
        economy="jobs">Homes have been lost; jobs shed; businesses shuttered</policy>. <policy
        health="health_care">Our health care is too costly</policy>; <policy education="schools">our
        schools fail too many</policy>; and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use
      energy <policy military="war">strengthen our adversaries</policy> and <policy
        environment="climate_change">threaten our planet</policy>. <tone emotion="stress">These are
        the indicators of crisis, subject to data and statistics. Less measurable, but no less
        profound is a sapping of confidence across our land, a nagging fear that America's decline
        is inevitable, that the next generation must lower its sights</tone>.</p>
    <p><tone emotion="stress">Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real. They are
        serious, and they are many</tone>. They will not be met easily or in a short span of time.
      But know this, America—they will be met.</p>
    <p>On this day, we gather because <tone emotion="optimistic">we have chosen hope over
        fear</tone>, <value type="unity">unity of purpose over conflict and discord</value>. On this
      day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations
      and wornout dogmas that for far too long have strained our politics. We remain a young Nation,
      but in the words of <value type="religion">Scripture</value>, the time has come to set aside
      childish things. The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit, to choose our better
      history, to carry forward that precious gift, that noble idea passed on from generation to
      generation, the <value type="religion">God-given</value> promise that <value type="equality"
        >all are equal, all are free, and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of
        happiness</value>.</p>
    <p>In reaffirming the greatness of our Nation, we understand that greatness is never a given. It
      must be earned. Our journey has never been one of shortcuts or settling for less. <value
        type="action">It has not been the path for the fainthearted, for those who prefer leisure
        over work or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame. Rather, it has been the risk
        takers, the doers, the makers of things, some celebrated, but more often men and women
        obscure in their labor who have carried us up the long rugged path towards prosperity and
        freedom</value>. <tone rhetoric="appeal_to_past">For us, they packed up their few worldly
        possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life. For us, they toiled in
        sweatshops and settled the West, endured the lash of the whip, and plowed the hard earth.
        For us, they fought and died in places like Concord and Gettysburg, Normandy and Khe
        Sahn</tone>.</p>
    <p>Time and again, these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked until their hands
      were raw so that we might live a better life. They saw America as bigger than the sum of our
      individual ambitions, greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction.</p>
    <p>This is the journey we continue today. <tone emotion="pride">We remain the most prosperous,
        powerful Nation on Earth</tone>. Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis
      began. Our minds are no less inventive, our goods and services no less needed than they were
      last week, or last month, or last year. Our capacity remains undiminished, and our time of
      standing pat and protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions—that time
      has surely passed. <value type="action">Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust
        ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America</value>.</p>
    <p><tone emotion="stress">For everywhere we look, there is work to be done</tone>. <policy
        economy="general">The state of our economy calls for action, bold and swift</policy>. <value
        type="action">And we will act</value>, not only to <policy economy="jobs">create new
        jobs</policy>, but to <value type="progress">lay a new foundation for growth</value>.
        <policy economy="industry">We will build the roads and bridges, the electric grids and
        digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together</policy>. <value
        type="restoration">We will restore science to its rightful place</value> and wield
      technology's wonders to <policy health="health_care">raise health care's quality and lower its
        cost</policy>. <policy environment="renewable ">We will harness the sun and the winds and
        the soil to fuel our cars</policy> and <policy economy="industry">run our
      factories</policy>. <policy education="schools">And we will transform our schools and colleges
        and universities</policy>
      <value type="progress">to meet the demands of a new age</value>. <tone emotion="optimistic"
        >All this we can do. All this we will do</tone>.</p>
    <p>Now, there are some who question the scale of our ambitions, who suggest that our system
      cannot tolerate too many big plans. Their memories are short. For they have forgotten what
      this country has already done, what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined
      to common purpose and necessity to courage. What the cynics fail to understand is that the
      ground has shifted beneath them, that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for
      so long no longer apply.</p>
    <p>The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether
      it works—whether it helps <policy economy="jobs">families find jobs at a decent wage, care
        they can afford, a retirement that is dignified</policy>. Where the answer is yes, we intend
      to move forward. Where the answer is no, programs will end. Those of us who manage the
      public's dollars will be held to account—to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our
      business in the light of day—because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people
      and their government.</p>
    <p>Nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill. Its power to
      generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched. <tone emotion="stress">But this crisis has
        reminded us that without a watchful eye</tone>, the market can spin out of control and that
      a nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous. <policy economy="general">The
        success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our gross domestic
        product, but on the reach of our prosperity, on the ability to extend opportunity to every
        willing heart—not out of charity, but because it is the surest route to our common
        good</policy>.</p>
    <p>As for our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals.
        <tone rhetoric="appeal to past">Our Founding Fathers, faced with perils that we can scarcely
        imagine, drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man, a charter
        expanded by the blood of generations</tone>. Those ideals still light the world, and we will
      not give them up for expedience sake. And so to all the other peoples and governments who are
      watching today, from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born, know
      that <policy foreign="internationalism">America is a friend of each nation and every man, woman,
        and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity and that we are ready to lead once
        more</policy>.</p>
    <p>Recall that earlier generations <value type="democracy">faced down fascism and
        communism</value>, <policy foreign="internationalism">not just with missiles and tanks, but with
        sturdy alliances and enduring convictions</policy>. They understood that our power alone
      cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please. Instead, they knew that our
      power grows through its prudent use. <tone emotion="pride">Our security emanates from the
        justness of our cause, the force of our example</tone>, the tempering qualities of humility
      and restraint. We are the keepers of this legacy. Guided by these principles once more, we can
      meet those new threats that demand even greater effort, <policy foreign="alliances">even
        greater cooperation and understanding between nations</policy>.</p>
    <p><policy military="war">We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people and forge a
        hard-earned peace in Afghanistan. With old friends and former foes, we will work tirelessly
        to lessen the nuclear threat</policy> and roll back the specter of a <policy
        environment="climate change">warming planet</policy>. <tone emotion="provoking">We will not
        apologize for our way of life</tone>, <policy foreign="internationalism">nor
        will we waiver in its defense. And for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing
        terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot
        be broken. You cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you</policy>.</p>
    <p>For we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness. <value type="equality"
        >We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus, and nonbelievers</value>. We
      are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth. <tone
        rhetoric="appeal to past">And because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and
        segregation and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united</tone>, we cannot
      help but <tone emotion="optimistic">believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass</tone>;
      that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the world grows smaller, our common
      humanity shall reveal itself; and that <policy foreign="internationalism">America must play its
        role in ushering in a new era of peace</policy>.</p>
    <p><policy foreign="alliance">To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward based on mutual
        interest and mutual respect. To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict or
        blame their society's ills on the West, know that your people will judge you on what you can
        build, not what you destroy</policy>.</p>
    <p>To those who claim power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know
      that you are on the wrong side of history, but that we will extend a hand if you are willing
      to unclench your fist.</p>
    <p><policy foreign="internationalism">To the people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside you
        to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow; to nourish starved bodies and feed
        hungry minds. And to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can no
        longer afford indifference to the suffering outside our borders</policy>, <policy
        environment="climate">nor can we consume the world's resources without regard to
        effect</policy>. <value type="progress">For the world has changed, and we must change with
        it</value>.</p>
    <p>As we consider the role that unfolds before us, <policy military="soldiers">we will remember
        with humble gratitude those brave Americans who at this very hour patrol far off deserts and
        distant mountains. They have something to tell us, just as the fallen heroes who lie in
        Arlington whisper through the ages. We honor them not only because they are the guardians of
        our liberty, but because they embody the spirit of service, a willingness to find meaning in
        something greater than themselves</policy>. <tone emotion="stress">And yet at this moment—a
        moment that will define a generation</tone>—it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us
      all. For as much as government can do and must do, it is ultimately the faith and
      determination of the American people upon which this Nation relies. It is the kindness to take
      in a stranger when the levees break, the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their
      hours than see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours. It is the
      firefighter's courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke, but also a parent's willingness
      to nurture a child that finally decides our fate.</p>
    <p>Our challenges may be new. The instruments with which we meet them may be new. But those
      values upon which our success depends—honesty and hard work, courage and fair play, tolerance
      and curiosities, loyalty and patriotism—these things are old. These things are true. They have
      been the quiet force of progress throughout our history. What is demanded, <value
        type="restoration">then, is a return to these truths</value>; what is required of us now is
      a new era of responsibility—a recognition, on the part of every American, that we have duties
      to ourselves, our Nation, and the world; duties that we do not grudgingly accept but, rather,
      seize gladly, firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so
      defining of our character, <tone emotion="stress">than giving our all to a difficult
        task</tone>.</p>
    <p>This is the price and the promise of citizenship. This is the source of our
        confidences—<value type="religion">the knowledge that God calls on us</value>
      <tone emotion="stress">to shape an uncertain destiny</tone>.</p>
    <p><tone emotion="pride">This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed—why men and women and
        children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent Mall,
        and why a man whose father, less than 60 years ago, might not have been served at a local
        restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath</tone>.</p>
    <p>So let us mark this day with remembrance of who we are and how far we have traveled. <tone
        rhetoric="appeal_to_past">In the year of America's birth, in the coldest of months, a small
        band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the shores of an icy river. The capital was
        abandoned. The enemy was advancing. The snow was stained with blood. At a moment when the
        outcome of our Revolution was most in doubt, the Father of our Nation ordered these words be
        read to the people:</tone></p>
    <p>“Let it be told to the future world…that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and
      virtue could survive…that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth
      to meet [it].”</p>
    <p><tone emotion="stress">America: In the face of our common dangers, in this winter of our
        hardship, let us remember these timeless words</tone>. <tone emotion="optimistic">With hope
        and virtue, let us brave once more the icy currents and endure what storms may come</tone>.
        <tone rhetoric="appeal_to_past">Let it be said by our children's children that when we were
        tested, we refused to let this journey end, that we did not turn back, nor did we
        falter</tone>; and with eyes fixed on the horizon and <value type="religion">God's grace
        upon us</value>, we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to
      future generations.</p>
    <p>Thank you. <value type="religion">God bless you. And God bless the United States of
        America</value>.</p>
