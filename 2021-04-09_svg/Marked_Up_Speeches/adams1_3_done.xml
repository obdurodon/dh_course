    <body>
        <p> When it was first perceived, in early times, that no middle course for America remained
            between unlimited submission to a foreign legislature and
                a total independence of its claims, men of reflection were less apprehensive
            of danger from the formidable power offleets and armies they must determine to resist
            than from those contests and dissensions which would certainly arise concerning the forms
            of government to be instituted over thewhole and over the parts of this extensive
            country. Relying, however, on the purity of their intentions, the justice of their cause,
            and the integrity and intelligence of the people, under anoverruling <value
                type ="religion">Providence</value> which had so signally protected this country from
            the first, the representatives of this nation, then consisting of little more than half
            its present number, not only broke to pieces the chains which were forging and the rod of
            iron that was lifted up, but frankly cut asunder theties which had bound them, and
            launched into an ocean of uncertainty.</p>

        <p>The zeal and ardor of the people during the Revolutionary
            war, supplying the place of government, <tone emotion="confident">commanded a degree
                of order sufficient at least for the temporary preservation of society</tone>. <tone rhetoric = "appeal to history">The
            Confederation which was early felt to be necessary was prepared from the models of the
            Batavian and Helvetic confederacies</tone>, the only examples which remain with any detail and
            precision in history, and certainly the only ones which the people at large had ever
            considered. But reflecting on the striking difference in so many particulars between
            this country and those where a courier may go from the seat of government to the
            frontier in a single day, <tone emotion="reflective">it was then certainly foreseen by
                some who assisted in Congress at the formation of it that it could not be
                durable</tone>. </p>

        <p>Negligence of its regulations, inattention to its recommendations, if not disobedience
            toits authority, not only in individuals but in States, soon appeared with <tone
                emotion="stressed">their melancholy consequences—universal languor, jealousies and
                rivalries of States, declineof navigation and commerce, discouragement of necessary
                manufactures, universal fall inthe value of lands and their produce, contempt of
                public and private faith, loss ofconsideration and credit with foreign nations, and
                at length in discontents,animosities, combinations, partial conventions, and
                insurrection, threatening some greatnational calamity</tone>. </p>

        <p>In this dangerous crisis the <value type="unity">people of America</value> were not
            abandoned by their usual goodsense, presence of mind, resolution, or integrity. Measures
            were pursued to concert a plan to <value type="democracy">form a more perfect union,
                establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity,provide for the common defense,
                promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings ofliberty</value>. The public
            disquisitions, discussions, and deliberations issued in the present happy Constitution
            of Government. </p>

        <p>Employed in the service of my country abroad during the whole course of these
            transactions, I first saw the Constitution of the United States in a foreign country.
                <tone emotion="pretentious">Irritated by no literary altercation, animated by no
                public debate, heated by no party animosity</tone>, I read it with great
            satisfaction, as the result of good heads prompted by good hearts, as an experiment
            better adapted to the genius, character, situation, and relations of this nation and
            country than any which had ever been proposed or suggested. In its general principles
            and great outlines it was conformable to such a system of government <tone
                emotion="proud">as I had ever most esteemed</tone>, and in some States, my own
            native State inparticular, had contributed to establish. <policy government = "suffrage">Claiming a right of suffrage</policy>,
            in common with my fellow-citizens, in the adoption or rejection of a constitution which
            was to rule me and my posterity, as well as them and theirs, <tone emotion="confident">I
                did not hesitate</tone> to express my approbation of it on all occasions, in public
            and in private. <tone emotion="confident">It was not then, nor has been since, any
                objection to it in my mind</tone> that the Executive and Senate were not more
            permanent. Nor have I ever entertained a thought of promoting any alteration in it but
            such as the people themselves, in the course of their experience, should see and feel to
            be necessary or expedient, and by their representatives in Congress and the State
            legislatures, according to the Constitution itself, adopt and ordain.</p>

        <p>Returning to the bosom of my country after a <tone emotion="sad">painful</tone>
            separation from it for ten years, <tone emotion="proud">I had the honor</tone> to be
            elected to a station under the new order of things, and I have repeatedly laid myself
            under the most serious obligations to <policy government ="consitution">support the
                Constitution</policy>. The operation of it has equaled the most sanguine expectations
            of its friends, and from an habitual attention to it, satisfaction in its
            administration, and delight in its effects upon the peace, order, prosperity, and
            happiness of the nation I have acquiredan <tone emotion="fondness">habitual attachment
                to it and veneration for it</tone> . </p>

        <p>What other form of government, indeed, can so well deserve <value type ="unity">our
                esteem and love</value>? </p>

        <p>There may be little solidity in an ancient idea that congregations of men into cities and
            nations are the most pleasing objects in the sight of superior intelligences, but this
            is very certain, that to a benevolent human mind there can be no spectacle presented by
            any nation more <tone emotion="proud">pleasing, more noble, majestic, or august, than
                an assembly like that which has so often been seen in this and the other Chamber of
                Congress</tone>, of a Government in which the Executive authority, as well as that
            of all the branches of the Legislature, <policy government = "suffrage">are exercised by citizens selected at regular
            periods by their neighbors to make and execute laws for the general good</policy>. Can anything
            essential, anything more than mere ornament and decoration, be added to this by robes
            and diamonds? Can authority be more amiable and respectable when it descends from
            accidents or institutions established in remote antiquity than when it springs fresh
            from the hearts and judgments of an honest and enlightened people? <policy
                government ="suffrage">For it is the people only that are represented</policy>. It is
                <tone emotion="inspiring">their power and majesty</tone> that is reflected,
            and only for their good, in every legitimate government, under whatever form it may
            appear. The existence of such a government asours for any length of time is a full proof
            of a general dissemination of knowledge and virtue throughout the whole body of the
            people. And what object or consideration more pleasing than this can be presented to the
            human mind? <value type="patriotism">If national pride is ever justifiable or
                excusable it is when it springs, not from power or riches, grandeur or glory, but
                from conviction of national innocence, information, and benevolence</value>.</p>

        <p>In the midst of these pleasing ideas we should be unfaithful to ourselves if we should
            ever lose sight of the <tone emotion="stressed">danger to our liberties if anything
                partial or extraneous should infect the purity of our free, fair, virtuous, and
                independent elections</tone>. <value type = "democracy">If an election is to be determined by a majority of a
            single vote, and that can be procured by a party through artifice or corruption, the
            Government may be the choice of a party for its own ends, not of the nation for the
            national good</value>. If that solitary suffrage can be obtained by foreign nations by flattery
            or menaces, by fraud or violence, by terror, intrigue, or venality, the Government may
            not be the choice of the American people, but of foreign nations. 
                It may be foreign nations who govern us, and not we, the
                people, who govern ourselves; and candid men will acknowledge that in such cases
                choice would have little advantage to boast of over lot or chance.</p>

        <p>Such is the amiable and interesting system of government (and such are some of the abuses
            to which it may be exposed) which the people of America have exhibited to the admiration
            and anxiety of the wise and virtuous of all nations for eight years under the
            administration of a citizen who, by a <tone emotion="proud">long course of great
                actions, regulated by prudence, justice, temperance, and fortitude, conducting a
                people inspired with the same virtues and animated with the same ardent patriotism
                and love of liberty to independence and peace, to increasing wealth and unexampled
                prosperity, has merited the gratitude of his fellow-citizens, commanded the highest
                praises of foreign nations, and secured immortal glory with posterity</tone>.</p>

        <p>In that retirement which is his voluntary choice may he long live to enjoy the delicious
            recollection of his services, the gratitude of mankind, the happy fruits of them to
            himself and the world, which are daily increasing, and that splendid prospect of the
            future fortunes of this country which is opening from year to year. His name may best
            ill a rampart, and the knowledge that he lives a bulwark, against all open or secret
            enemies of his country’s peace. This example has been recommended to the imitation of
            his successors by both Houses of Congress and by the voice of the legislatures and the
            people throughout the nation.</p>

        <p>On this subject it might become me better to be silent or to speak with diffidence; but
            as something may be expected, the occasion, I hope, will be admitted as an apology if I
            venture to say that if a preference, upon principle, of a <value type="liberty">free
                republican government</value>,formed upon long and serious reflection, after a
            diligent and impartial inquiry after truth; if an attachment to
                the Constitution of the United States, and a conscientious determination to support
                it until it shall be altered by the judgments and wishes of the people, expressed in
                the mode prescribed in it; if a <policy government = "states rights">respectful attention to the constitutions of the
                individual States and a constant caution and delicacy toward the State governments;
                if an equal and impartial regard to the rights, interest, honor, and happiness of
                all the States in the Union, without preference or regard to a northern or southern,
                an eastern or western, position, their various political opinions on unessential
                points or their personal attachments</policy>; if a love of virtuous men of all parties and
                denominations; if a love of science and letters and a wish to patronize every
                rational effort to encourage schools, colleges, universities, academies, and every
                institution for propagating knowledge, virtue, and religion among all classes of the
                people, not only for their benign influence on the happiness of life in all its
                stages and classes, and of society in all its forms, but as the only means of
                preserving our Constitution from its natural enemies, the spirit of sophistry, the
                spirit of party, the spirit of intrigue, the profligacy of corruption, and the
                <policy foreign = "isolationism">pestilence of foreign influence, which is the angel of destruction to elective
                governments</policy>; if a love of equal laws, of justice, and humanity in the interior
                administration; if an inclination to improve agriculture, commerce, and
                manufacturers for necessity, convenience, and defense; if a spirit of equity and
                humanity toward the aboriginal nations of America, and a disposition to meliorate
                their condition by inclining them to be more friendly to us, and our citizens to be
                more friendly to them; if an inflexible determination to maintain peace and
                inviolable faith with all nations, and that system of neutrality and impartiality
                among the belligerent powers of Europe which has been adopted by this Government and
                so solemnly sanctioned by both Houses of Congress and applauded by the legislatures
                of the States and the public opinion, until it shall be otherwise ordained by
                Congress; if a personal esteem for the French nation, formed in a residence of seven
                years chiefly among them, and a sincere desire to preserve the friendship which has
                been so much for the honor and interest of both nations; if, while the conscious
                honor and integrity of the people of America and the internal sentiment of their own
                power and energies must be preserved, an earnest endeavor to investigate every just
                cause and remove every colorable pretense of complaint; if an intention to pursue by
                amicable negotiation a reparation for the injuries that have been committed on the
                commerce of our fellow-citizens by whatever nation, and if success can not be
                obtained, to lay the facts before the Legislature, that they may consider what
                further measures the honor and interest of the Government and its constituents
                demand; if a resolution to do justice as far as may depend upon me, at all times and
                to all nations, and maintain peace,friendship, and benevolence with all the world;
                if an unshaken confidence in the honor,spirit, and resources of the American
                people, on which I have so often hazarded my all and never been deceived; if
            elevated ideas of the high destinies of this country and of my own duties toward it,
            founded on a knowledge of the moral principles and intellectual improvements of the
            people deeply engraven on my mind in early life, and not obscured but exalted by
            experience and age; and, with humble reverence, I feel it to be my duty to add, if a
            veneration for the religion of a people who profess and call themselves Christians, and
            a fixed resolution to consider a <value type = "religion">decent respect for Christianity</value> among the best
            recommendations for the public service, can enable me in any degree to comply with your
            wishes, it shall be my strenuous endeavor that this sagacious injunction of the two
            Houses shall not be without effect.</p>

        <p>With this great example before me, with the sense and spirit, the faith and honor, the
            duty and interest, of the <value type="unity">same American people pledged to support
                the Constitution of the United States, I entertain no doubt of its continuance in
                all its energy</value>, and my mind is prepared without hesitation to lay myself
            under the most solemn obligations to support it to the utmost of my power. </p>
        <p> And may that <value type="religion">Being who is supreme over all</value> , <value
                type="religion">the Patron of Order</value> , <value type="religion">the Fountain
                of Justice</value> , and the <value type="religion">Protector</value> in all ages
            of the world of virtuous liberty, continue <value type="religion">His</value> blessing upon
            this nation and its Government and giveit all possible success and duration consistent
            with the ends of <value type="religion">His</value> providence. </p>
