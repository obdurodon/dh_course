       <body>
              <p>My friends, before I begin the expression of those thoughts that I deem appropriate
                     to this moment, <value type="religion">would you permit me the privilege of
                            uttering a little private prayer of my own. And I ask that you bow your
                            heads:</value></p>
              <p><value type="religion">Almighty God, as we stand here at this moment my future
                            associates in the executive branch of government join me in beseeching
                            that Thou will make full and complete our dedication to the service of
                            the people in this throng, and their fellow citizens everywhere. Give
                            us, we pray, the power to discern clearly right from wrong, and allow
                            all our words and actions to be governed thereby, and by the laws of
                            this land. Especially we pray that our concern shall be for all the
                            people regardless of station, race, or calling. May cooperation be
                            permitted and be the mutual aim of those who, under the concepts of our
                            Constitution, hold to differing political faiths; so that all may work
                            for the good of our beloved country and Thy glory. Amen</value>.</p>
              <p>My fellow citizens:</p>
              <p><tone emotion="stress">The world and we have passed the midway point of a century
                            of continuing challenge</tone>. We sense with all our faculties that
                     forces of good and evil are massed and armed and opposed as rarely before in
                     history.</p>
              <p>This fact defines the meaning of this day. We are summoned by this honored and
                     historic ceremony to witness more than the act of one citizen swearing his oath
                     of service, <value type="religion">in the presence of God</value>. <tone
                            emotion="optimistic">We are called as a people to give testimony in the
                            sight of the world to our faith that the future shall belong to the
                            free</tone>.</p>
              <p>Since this century’s beginning, a time of tempest has seemed to come upon the
                     continents of the earth. Masses of Asia have awakened to strike off shackles of
                     the past. Great nations of Europe have fought their bloodiest wars. Thrones
                     have toppled and their vast empires have disappeared. New nations have been
                     born.</p>
              <p><tone rhetoric="appeal_to_past">For our own country, it has been a time of
                            recurring trial. We have grown in power and in responsibility. We have
                            passed through the anxieties of depression and of war to a summit
                            unmatched in man’s history. Seeking to secure peace in the world, we
                            have had to fight through the forests of the Argonne, to the shores of
                            Iwo Jima, and to the cold mountains of Korea</tone>.</p>
              <p>In the swift rush of great events, we find ourselves groping to know the full sense
                     and meaning of these times in which we live. In our quest of understanding,
                            <value type="religion">we beseech God’s guidance</value>. We summon all
                     our knowledge of the past and we scan all signs of the future. We bring all our
                     wit and all our will to meet the question:</p>
              <p>How far have we come in man’s long pilgrimage from darkness toward light? Are we
                     nearing the light—a day of freedom and of peace for all mankind? Or are the
                     shadows of another night closing in upon us?</p>
              <p>Great as are the preoccupations absorbing us at home, concerned as we are with
                     matters that deeply affect our livelihood today and our vision of the future,
                     each of these domestic problems is dwarfed by, and often even created by, this
                     question that involves all humankind.</p>
              <p>This trial comes at a moment when man’s power to achieve good or to inflict evil
                     surpasses the brightest hopes and the sharpest fears of all ages. We can turn
                     rivers in their courses, level mountains to the plains. Oceans and land and sky
                     are avenues for our colossal commerce. Disease diminishes and life
                     lengthens.</p>
              <p>Yet the promise of this life is imperiled by the very genius that has made it
                     possible. Nations amass wealth. Labor sweats to create—and turns out devices to
                     level not only mountains but also cities. <tone emotion="pesimistic">Science
                            seems ready to confer upon us, as its final gift, the power to erase
                            human life from this planet</tone>.</p>
              <p><tone rhetoric="appeal_to_past">At such a time in history, we who are free must
                            proclaim anew our faith. This faith is the abiding creed of our
                            fathers</tone>. It is our faith in the deathless dignity of man,
                     governed by eternal moral and natural laws.</p>
              <p>This faith defines our full view of life. It establishes, beyond debate, <value
                            type="religion">those gifts of the Creator that are man’s inalienable
                            rights, and that make all men equal in His sight</value>.</p>
              <p>In the light of this equality, we know that the virtues most cherished by free
                     people—love of truth, pride of work, <value type="patriotism">devotion to
                            country</value>—<value type="equality">all are treasures equally
                            precious in the lives of the most humble and of the most
                     exalted</value>. The men who mine coal and fire furnaces and balance ledgers
                     and turn lathes and pick cotton and heal the sick and plant corn—all serve as
                     proudly, and as profitably, for America as the statesmen who draft treaties and
                     the legislators who enact laws.</p>
              <p>This faith rules our whole way of life. <value type="democracy">It decrees that we,
                            the people, elect leaders not to rule but to serve</value>. It asserts
                     that we have the right to choice of our own work and to the reward of our own
                     toil. It inspires the initiative that makes our productivity the wonder of the
                     world. <value type="equality">And it warns that any man who seeks to deny
                            equality among all his brothers betrays the spirit of the free and
                            invites the mockery of the tyrant</value>.</p>
              <p>It is because we, all of us, hold to these principles that the political changes
                     accomplished this day do not imply turbulence, upheaval or disorder. Rather
                     this change expresses a purpose of strengthening our dedication and devotion to
                     the precepts of our founding documents, a conscious renewal of faith in our
                     country and in the <value type="religion">watchfulness of a Divine
                            Providence</value>.</p>
              <p><value type="religion">The enemies of this faith know no god but force</value>, no
                     devotion but its use. <tone emotion="provoking">They tutor men in treason. They
                            feed upon the hunger of others. Whatever defies them, they torture,
                            especially the truth</tone>.</p>
              <p>Here, then, is joined no argument between slightly differing philosophies. This
                     conflict strikes directly at the faith of our fathers and the lives of our
                     sons. No principle or treasure that we hold, from the spiritual knowledge of
                     our free schools and churches to the creative magic of free labor and capital,
                     nothing lies safely beyond the reach of this struggle.</p>
              <p><value type="liberty">Freedom is pitted against slavery; lightness against the
                            dark</value>.</p>
              <p><policy foreign="internationalism">The faith we hold belongs not to us alone but to
                            the free of all the world. This common bond binds the grower of rice in
                            Burma and the planter of wheat in Iowa, the shepherd in southern Italy
                            and the mountaineer in the Andes. It confers a common dignity upon the
                            French soldier who dies in Indo-China, the British soldier killed in
                            Malaya, the American life given in Korea</policy>.</p>
              <p>We know, beyond this, that we are linked to all free peoples not merely by a noble
                     idea but by a simple need. <policy foreign="internationalism">No free people
                            can for long cling to any privilege or enjoy any safety in economic
                            solitude. For all our own material might, even we need markets in the
                            world for the surpluses of our farms and our factories. Equally, we need
                            for these same farms and factories vital materials and products of
                            distant lands. This basic law of interdependence, so manifest in the
                            commerce of peace, applies with thousand-fold intensity in the event of
                            war</policy>.</p>
              <p><value type="unity">So we are persuaded by necessity and by belief that the
                            strength of all free peoples lies in unity; their danger, in
                            discord</value>.</p>
              <p>To produce this unity, to meet the challenge of our time, <policy
                            foreign="internationalism">destiny has laid upon our country the
                            responsibility of the free world’s leadership</policy>.</p>
              <p>So it is proper that we assure our friends once again that, in the discharge of
                     this responsibility, we Americans know and we observe the difference between
                     world leadership and imperialism; between firmness and truculence; between a
                     thoughtfully calculated goal and spasmodic reaction to the stimulus of
                     emergencies.</p>
              <p>We wish our friends the world over to know this above all: we face the threat—not
                     with dread and confusion—but with confidence and conviction.</p>
              <p>We feel this moral strength because we know that we are not helpless prisoners of
                     history. <value type="liberty">We are free men. We shall remain free, never to
                            be proven guilty of the one capital offense against freedom, a lack of
                            stanch faith</value>.</p>
              <p>In pleading our just cause before the bar of history and in pressing our labor for
                     world peace, we shall be guided by certain fixed principles.</p>
              <p>These principles are:</p>
              <p><policy military="peace">Abhorring war as a chosen way to balk the purposes of
                            those who threaten us, we hold it to be the first task of statesmanship
                            to develop the strength that will deter the forces of aggression and
                            promote the conditions of peace. For, as it must be the supreme purpose
                            of all free men, so it must be the dedication of their leaders, to save
                            humanity from preying upon itself</policy>. <policy
                            foreign="internationalism">In the light of this principle, we stand
                            ready to engage with any and all others in joint effort to remove the
                            causes of mutual fear and distrust among nations</policy>, <policy
                            military="peace">so as to make possible drastic reduction of
                            armaments</policy>. <value type="equality">The sole requisites for
                            undertaking such effort are that—in their purpose—they be aimed
                            logically and honestly toward secure peace for all</value>; and that—in
                     their result—they provide methods by which every participating nation will
                     prove good faith in carrying out its pledge.</p>
              <p>Realizing that common sense and common decency alike dictate the futility of
                     appeasement, we shall never try to placate an aggressor by the false and wicked
                     bargain of trading honor for security. Americans, indeed all free men, remember
                     that in the final choice a soldier’s pack is not so heavy a burden as a
                     prisoner’s chains. Knowing that only a United States that is strong and
                     immensely productive can help defend freedom in our world, we view our Nation’s
                     strength and security as a trust upon which rests the hope of free men
                     everywhere. <value type="patriotism">It is the firm duty of each of our free
                            citizens and of every free citizen everywhere to place the cause of his
                            country before the comfort, the convenience of himself</value>. Honoring
                     the identity and the special heritage of each nation in the world, we shall
                     never use our strength to try to impress upon another people our own cherished
                     political and economic institutions. Assessing realistically the needs and
                     capacities of proven friends of freedom, we shall strive to help them to
                     achieve their own security and well-being. Likewise, we shall count upon them
                     to assume, within the limits of their resources, their full and just burdens in
                     the common defense of freedom. Recognizing economic health as an indispensable
                     basis of military strength and the free world’s peace, we shall strive to
                     foster everywhere, and to practice ourselves, policies that encourage
                     productivity and profitable trade. For the impoverishment of any single people
                     in the world means danger to the well-being of all other peoples. <policy
                            foreign="internationalism">Appreciating that economic need, military
                            security and political wisdom combine to suggest regional groupings of
                            free peoples, we hope, within the framework of the United Nations, to
                            help strengthen such special bonds the world over. The nature of these
                            ties must vary with the different problems of different areas. In the
                            Western Hemisphere, we enthusiastically join with all our neighbors in
                            the work of perfecting a community of fraternal trust and common
                            purpose</policy>.</p>
              <p><value type="unity">In Europe, we ask that enlightened and inspired leaders of the
                            Western nations strive with renewed vigor to make the unity of their
                            peoples a reality</value>. Only as free Europe unitedly marshals its
                     strength can it effectively safeguard, even with our help, its spiritual and
                     cultural heritage.</p>
              <p><value type="liberty">Conceiving the defense of freedom, like freedom itself, to be
                            one and indivisible, we hold all continents and peoples in equal regard
                            and honor</value>. <value type="equality">We reject any insinuation that
                            one race or another, one people or another, is in any sense inferior or
                            expendable</value>. <policy foreign="internationalism">Respecting the
                            United Nations as the living sign of all people’s hope for peace, we
                            shall strive to make it not merely an eloquent symbol but an effective
                            force</policy>. And in our quest for an honorable peace, we shall
                     neither compromise, nor tire, nor ever cease. By these rules of conduct, we
                     hope to be known to all peoples.</p>
              <p><policy military="peace">By their observance, an earth of peace may become not a
                            vision but a fact</policy>.</p>
              <p>This hope—this supreme aspiration—must rule the way we live.</p>
              <p><value type="patriotism">We must be ready to dare all for our country</value>. For
                     history does not long entrust the care of freedom to the weak or the timid.
                            <policy military="strength">We must acquire proficiency in defense and
                            display stamina in purpose</policy>.</p>
              <p>We must be willing, individually and as a Nation, to accept whatever sacrifices may
                     be required of us. A people that values its privileges above its principles
                     soon loses both.</p>
              <p>These basic precepts are not lofty abstractions, far removed from matters of daily
                     living. They are laws of spiritual strength that generate and define our
                     material strength. <value type="patriotism">Patriotism means equipped forces
                            and a prepared citizenry</value>. Moral stamina means more energy and
                     more productivity, on the farm and in the factory. <value type="liberty">Love
                            of liberty means the guarding of every resource that makes freedom
                            possible</value>—from the sanctity of our families and the wealth of our
                     soil to <value type="science">the genius of our scientists</value>.</p>
              <p>And so each citizen plays an indispensable role. The productivity of our heads, our
                     hands, and our hearts is the source of all the strength we can command, for
                     both the enrichment of our lives and the winning of the peace.</p>
              <p>No person, no home, no community can be beyond the reach of this call. We are
                     summoned to act in wisdom and in conscience, to work with industry, to teach
                     with persuasion, to preach with conviction, to weigh our every deed with care
                     and with compassion. For this truth must be clear before us: whatever America
                     hopes to bring to pass in the world must first come to pass in the heart of
                     America.</p>
              <p><policy military="peace">The peace we seek, then, is nothing less than the practice
                            and fulfillment of our whole faith among ourselves and in our dealings
                            with others. This signifies more than the stilling of guns, easing the
                            sorrow of war. More than escape from death, it is a way of life. More
                            than a haven for the weary, it is a hope for the brave</policy>.</p>
              <p>This is the hope that beckons us onward in this century of trial. <value
                            type="religion">This is the work that awaits us all, to be done with
                            bravery, with charity, and with prayer to Almighty God</value>.</p>
