    <body>
        <p>When four years ago we met to inaugurate a President, the Republic, single-minded in
            anxiety, stood in spirit here. <value type="security">We dedicated ourselves to the
                fulfillment of a vision—to speed the time when there would be for all the people
                that security and peace essential to the pursuit of happiness</value>. We of the
            Republic pledged ourselves to drive from the temple of our ancient faith those who had
            profaned it; to end by action, tireless and unafraid, the stagnation and despair of that
            day. We did those first things first. </p>
        <p>Our covenant with ourselves did not stop there. <policy government="governmental_aid"
                >Instinctively we recognized a deeper need—the need to find through government the
                instrument of our united purpose to solve for the individual the ever-rising
                problems of a complex civilization. Repeated attempts at their solution without the
                aid of government had left us baffled and bewildered</policy>. For, without that
            aid, we had been unable to create those moral controls over the services of science
            which are necessary to make science a useful servant instead of a ruthless master of
            mankind. To do this we knew that we must find practical controls over blind economic
            forces and blindly selfish men.</p>

        <p><value type="democracy">We of the Republic sensed the truth that democratic government
                has innate capacity to protect its people against disasters once considered
                inevitable, to solve problems once considered unsolvable</value>. We would not admit
            that we could not find a way to master economic epidemics just as, after centuries of
            fatalistic suffering, we had found a way to master epidemics of disease. We refused to
            leave the problems of our common welfare to be solved by the winds of chance and the
            hurricanes of disaster. </p>
        <p>In this we Americans were discovering no wholly new truth; we were writing a new chapter
            in our book of self-government.</p>

        <p><tone rhetoric="appeal_to_past">This year marks the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary
                of the Constitutional Convention which made us a nation. At that Convention our
                forefathers found the way out of the chaos which followed the Revolutionary War;
                they created a strong government with powers of united action sufficient then and
                now to solve problems utterly beyond individual or local solution. A century and a
                half ago they established the Federal Government in order to promote the general
                welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to the American people</tone>.</p>
        <p>Today we invoke those same powers of government to achieve the same objectives. Four
            years of new experience have not belied our historic instinct. They hold out the clear
            hope that government within communities, government within the separate States, and
            government of the United States can do the things the times require, without yielding
            its democracy. Our tasks in the last four years did not force democracy to take a
            holiday.</p>

        <p><policy government="large government">Nearly all of us recognize that as intricacies of
                human relationships increase, so power to govern them also must increase—power to
                stop evil; power to do good. The essential democracy of our Nation and the safety of
                our people depend not upon the absence of power, but upon lodging it with those whom
                the people can change or continue at stated intervals through an honest and free
                system of elections</policy>. The Constitution of 1787 did not make our democracy
            impotent. </p>
        <p>In fact, in these last four years, we have made the exercise of all power more
            democratic; for we have begun to bring private autocratic powers into their proper
            subordination to the public’s government. The legend that they were invincible—above and
            beyond the processes of a democracy—has been shattered. They have been challenged and
            beaten.</p>

        <p><tone emotion="pride">Our progress out of the depression is obvious</tone>. But that is
            not all that you and I mean by the new order of things. Our pledge was not merely to do
            a patchwork job with secondhand materials. By using the new materials of social justice
            we have undertaken to erect on the old foundations a more enduring structure <tone
                rhetoric="appeal_to_future">for the better use of future generations</tone>.</p>

        <p>In that purpose we have been helped by achievements of mind and spirit. Old truths have
            been relearned; untruths have been unlearned. We have always known that heedless
            self-interest was bad morals; we know now that it is bad economics. Out of the collapse
            of a prosperity whose builders boasted their practicality has come the conviction that
            in the long run economic morality pays. We are beginning to wipe out the line that
            divides the practical from the ideal; and in so doing we are fashioning an instrument of
            unimagined power for the establishment of a morally better world.</p>

        <p>This new understanding undermines the old admiration of worldly success as such. <tone
                emotion="provoking">We are beginning to abandon our tolerance of the abuse of power
                by those who betray for profit the elementary decencies of life</tone>.</p>

        <p>In this process evil things formerly accepted will not be so easily condoned.
            Hard-headedness will not so easily excuse hard-heartedness. We are moving toward an era
            of good feeling. But we realize that there can be no era of good feeling save among men
            of good will.</p>
        <p> For these reasons I am justified in believing that the greatest change we have witnessed
            has been the change in the moral climate of America.</p>

        <p>Among men of good will, science and democracy together offer an ever-richer life and
            ever-larger satisfaction to the individual. With this change in our moral climate and
            our rediscovered ability to improve our economic order, we have set our feet upon the
            road of enduring progress.</p>

        <p>Shall we pause now and turn our back upon the road that lies ahead? Shall we call this
            the promised land? Or, shall we continue on our way? For “each age is a dream that is
            dying, or one that is coming to birth.”</p>

        <p><value type="action">Many voices are heard as we face a great decision. Comfort says,
                “Tarry a while.” Opportunism says, “This is a good spot.” Timidity asks, “How
                difficult is the road ahead?”</value></p>

        <p>True, we have come far from the days of stagnation and despair. <value type="action"
                >Vitality has been preserved. Courage and confidence have been restored</value>.
            Mental and moral horizons have been extended.</p>

        <p>But our present gains were won under the pressure of more than ordinary circumstances.
            Advance became imperative under the goad of fear and suffering. The times were on the
            side of progress. </p>
        <p><tone emotion="stress">To hold to progress today, however, is more difficult. Dulled
                conscience, irresponsibility, and ruthless self-interest already reappear. Such
                symptoms of prosperity may become portents of disaster! Prosperity already tests the
                persistence of our progressive purpose</tone>.</p>

        <p>Let us ask again: Have we reached the goal of our vision of that fourth day of March
            1933? Have we found our happy valley?</p>

        <p><tone emotion="pride">I see a great nation, upon a great continent, blessed with a great
                wealth of natural resources</tone>. <policy foreign="internationalism">Its hundred
                and thirty million people are at peace among themselves; they are making their
                country a good neighbor among the nations</policy>. <value type="democracy">I see a
                United States which can demonstrate that, under democratic methods of government,
                national wealth can be translated into a spreading volume of human comforts hitherto
                unknown, and the lowest standard of living can be raised far above the level of mere
                subsistence</value>.</p>

        <p>But here is the challenge to our democracy: In this nation I see tens of millions of its
            citizens—a substantial part of its whole population—who at this very moment are denied
            the greater part of what the very lowest standards of today call the necessities of
            life.</p>

        <p><tone emotion="provoking">I see millions of families trying to live on incomes so meager
                that the pall of family disaster hangs over them day by day. I see millions whose
                daily lives in city and on farm continue under conditions labeled indecent by a
                so-called polite society half a century ago. I see millions denied education,
                recreation, and the opportunity to better their lot and the lot of their children. I
                see millions lacking the means to buy the products of farm and factory and by their
                poverty denying work and productiveness to many other millions. I see one-third of a
                nation ill-housed, ill-clad, ill-nourished</tone>.</p>

        <p><tone emotion="optimistic">It is not in despair that I paint you that picture. I paint it
                for you in hope—because the Nation, seeing and understanding the injustice in it,
                proposes to paint it out</tone>. <value type="equality">We are determined to make
                every American citizen the subject of his country’s interest and concern; and we
                will never regard any faithful law-abiding group within our borders as
                superfluous</value>. The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the
            abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too
            little.</p>

        <p><value type="action">If I know aught of the spirit and purpose of our Nation, we will not
                listen to Comfort, Opportunism, and Timidity. We will carry on</value>.</p>

        <p><tone emotion="pride">Overwhelmingly, we of the Republic are men and women of good will;
                men and women who have more than warm hearts of dedication; men and women who have
                cool heads and willing hands of practical purpose as well</tone>. They will insist
            that every agency of popular government use effective instruments to carry out their
            will.</p>

        <p>Government is competent when all who compose it work as trustees for the whole people. It
            can make constant progress when it keeps abreast of all the facts. It can obtain
            justified support and legitimate criticism when the people receive true information of
            all that government does.</p>

        <p>If I know aught of the will of our people, they will demand that these conditions of
            effective government shall be created and maintained. They will demand a nation
            uncorrupted by cancers of injustice and, therefore, strong among the nations in its
            example of the will to peace.</p>

        <p>Today we reconsecrate our country to long-cherished ideals in a suddenly changed
            civilization. <value type="unity">In every land there are always at work forces that
                drive men apart and forces that draw men together. In our personal ambitions we are
                individualists. But in our seeking for economic and political progress as a nation,
                we all go up, or else we all go down, as one people</value>.</p>
        <p><value type="humility">To maintain a democracy of effort requires a vast amount of
                patience in dealing with differing methods, a vast amount of humility. But out of
                the confusion of many voices rises an understanding of dominant public need</value>.
            Then political leadership can voice common ideals, and aid in their realization.</p>

        <p>In taking again the oath of office as President of the United States, I assume the solemn
            obligation of leading the American people forward along the road over which they have
            chosen to advance.</p>

        <p>
            <value type="religion">While this duty rests upon me I shall do my utmost to speak their
                purpose and to do their will, seeking Divine guidance to help us each and every one
                to give light to them that sit in darkness and to guide our feet into the way of
                peace</value>. </p>
