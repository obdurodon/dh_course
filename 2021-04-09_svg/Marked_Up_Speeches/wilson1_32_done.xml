        <p>There has been a change of government. It began two years ago, when the House of
            Representatives became Democratic by a decisive majority. It has now been completed. The
            Senate about to assemble will also be Democratic. The offices of President and
            Vice-President have been put into the hands of Democrats. What does the change mean?
            That is the question that is uppermost in our minds to-day. That is the question I am
            going to try to answer, in order, if I may, to interpret the occasion.</p>
        <p>It means much more than the mere success of a party. The success of a party means little
            except when the Nation is using that party for a large and definite purpose. No one can
            mistake the purpose for which the Nation now seeks to use the Democratic Party. It seeks
            to use it to interpret a change in its own plans and point of view. Some old things with
            which we had grown familiar, and which had begun to creep into the very habit of our
            thought and of our lives, have altered their aspect as we have latterly looked
            critically upon them, with fresh, awakened eyes; have dropped their disguises and shown
            themselves alien and sinister. <tone emotion="reflective">Some new things, as we look frankly upon them, willing to
            comprehend their real character, have come to assume the aspect of things long believed
            in and familiar, stuff of our own convictions. We have been refreshed by a new insight
            into our own life.</tone></p>
        <p><tone emotion="optimistic">We see that in many things that life is very great. It is incomparably great in its
            material aspects, in its body of wealth, in the diversity and sweep of its energy, in
            the industries which have been conceived and built up by the genius of individual men
            and the limitless enterprise of groups of men.</tone> It is great, also, very great, in its
            moral force. Nowhere else in the world have noble men and women exhibited in more
            striking forms the beauty and the energy of sympathy and helpfulness and counsel in
            their efforts to rectify wrong, alleviate suffering, and set the weak in the way of
            strength and hope. <tone emotion="proud">We have built up, moreover, a great system of government, which has
                stood through a long age as in many respects a model</tone> <value type="liberty">for those who seek to set liberty
                    upon foundations that will endure against fortuitous change,</value> against storm and accident.
            Our life contains every great thing, and contains it in rich abundance.</p>
        <p><policy economy="budget">But the evil has come with the good, and much fine gold has been corroded. With riches
            has come inexcusable waste.</policy> <tone emotion="stern">We have squandered a great part of what we might have used,</tone>
            <policy environment="conservation">and have not stopped to conserve the exceeding bounty of nature,</policy> without which our
            genius for enterprise would have been worthless and impotent, scorning to be careful,
            shamefully prodigal as well as admirably efficient. We have been proud of our industrial
            achievements, but we have not hitherto stopped thoughtfully enough to count the human
            cost, the cost of lives snuffed out, of energies overtaxed and broken, the fearful
            physical and spiritual cost to the men and women and children upon whom the dead weight
            and burden of it all has fallen pitilessly the years through. <tone emotion="stressed">The groans and agony of it
            all had not yet reached our ears, the solemn, moving undertone of our life, coming up
            out of the mines and factories, and out of every home where the struggle had its
            intimate and familiar seat.</tone> With the great Government went many deep secret things which
            we too long delayed to look into and scrutinize with candid, fearless eyes. <policy government="civil_service_reform">The great
            Government we loved has too often been made use of for private and selfish purposes, and
            those who used it had forgotten the people.</policy></p>
        <p>At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the
            good, the debased and decadent with the sound and vital. With this vision we approach
            new affairs. <value type="restoration">Our duty is to cleanse, to reconsider, to restore, to correct the evil
                without impairing the good,</value> to purify and humanize every process of our common life
            without weakening or sentimentalizing it. There has been something crude and heartless
            and unfeeling in our haste to succeed and be great. Our thought has been “Let every man
            look out for himself, let every generation look out for itself,” while we reared giant
            machinery which made it impossible that any but those who stood at the levers of control
            should have a chance to look out for themselves. We had not forgotten our morals. We
            remembered well enough that we had set up a policy which was meant to serve the humblest
            as well as the most powerful, with an eye single to the standards of justice and fair
            play, and remembered it with pride. But we were very heedless and in a hurry to be
            great.</p>
        <p><value type="restoration">We have come now to the sober second thought. The scales of heedlessness have fallen from
            our eyes. We have made up our minds to square every process of our national life again
            with the standards we so proudly set up at the beginning and have always carried at our
            hearts. Our work is a work of restoration.</value></p>
        <p>We have itemized with some degree of particularity the things that ought to be altered
            and here are some of the chief items: <policy economy="trade">A tariff which cuts us off from our proper part in
            the commerce of the world, violates the just principles of taxation, and makes the
            Government a facile instrument in the hand of private interests;</policy> <policy economy="currency">a banking and currency
            system based upon the necessity of the Government to sell its bonds fifty years ago and
            perfectly adapted to concentrating cash and restricting credits;</policy> <policy economy="regulation">an industrial system
            which, take it on all its sides, financial as well as administrative, holds capital in
            leading strings, restricts the liberties and limits the opportunities of labor,</policy> and
            <policy environment="conservation">exploits without renewing or conserving the natural resources of the country;</policy> a body of
            agricultural activities never yet given the efficiency of great business undertakings or
            served as it should be through the instrumentality of science taken directly to the
            farm, or afforded the facilities of credit best suited to its practical needs;
            watercourses undeveloped, waste places unreclaimed, forests untended, fast disappearing
            without plan or prospect of renewal, unregarded waste heaps at every mine. We have
            studied as perhaps no other nation has the most effective means of production, but we
            have not studied cost or economy as we should either as organizers of industry, as
            statesmen, or as individuals.</p>
        <p>Nor have we studied and perfected the means by which government may be put at the service
            of humanity, in safeguarding the health of the Nation, the health of its men and its
            women and its children, as well as their rights in the struggle for existence. This is
            no sentimental duty. The firm basis of government is justice, not pity. These are
            matters of justice. There can be no equality or opportunity, the first essential of
            justice in the body politic, if men and women and children be not shielded in their
            lives, their very vitality, from the consequences of great industrial and social
            processes which they can not alter, control, or singly cope with. Society must see to it
            that it does not itself crush or weaken or damage its own constituent parts. <value type="security">The first
                duty of law is to keep sound the society it serves.</value> <policy economy="regulation">Sanitary laws, pure food laws,</policy> and
            laws determining conditions of labor which individuals are powerless to determine for
            themselves are intimate parts of the very business of justice and legal efficiency.</p>
        <p>These are some of the things we ought to do, and not leave the others undone, the
            old-fashioned, never-to-be-neglected, fundamental safeguarding of property and of
            individual right. <tone emotion="inspiring">This is the high enterprise of the new day: To lift everything that
            concerns our life as a Nation to the light that shines from the hearthfire of every
            man’s conscience and vision of the right.</tone> <value type="unity">It is inconceivable that we should do this as
            partisans; it is inconceivable we should do it in ignorance of the facts as they are or
            in blind haste.</value> <value type="restoration">We shall restore, not destroy.</value> We shall deal with our economic system as
            it is and as it may be modified, not as it might be if we had a clean sheet of paper to
            write upon; and step by step we shall make it what it should be, in the spirit of those
            who question their own wisdom and seek counsel and knowledge, not shallow
            self-satisfaction or the excitement of excursions whither they can not tell. Justice,
            and only justice, shall always be our motto.</p>
        <p>And yet it will be no cool process of mere science. <tone emotion="provoking">The Nation has been deeply stirred,
            stirred by a solemn passion, stirred by the knowledge of wrong, of ideals lost, of
            government too often debauched and made an instrument of evil.</tone>The feelings with which we face this new age of
            right and opportunity sweep across our heartstrings <value type="religion">like some air out of God’s own presence,</value> where justice and mercy are reconciled
                and the judge and the brother are one.We know our task to be no mere
            task of politics but a task which shall search us through and through, whether we be
            able to understand our time and the need of our people, whether we be indeed their
            spokesmen and interpreters, whether we have the pure heart to comprehend and the
            rectified will to choose our high course of action.</p>
        <p><value type="unity">This is not a day of triumph; it is a day of dedication. Here muster, not the forces of
            party, but the forces of humanity.</value> Men’s hearts wait upon us; men’s lives hang in the
            balance; men’s hopes call upon us to say what we will do. Who shall live up to the great
            trust? Who dares fail to try? <value type="patriotism">I summon all honest men, all patriotic, all
                forward-looking men, to my side.</value> God helping me, I will not fail them,if they will but counsel
                and sustain me!</p>
