        <p>My fellow citizens, today, we celebrate the mystery of American renewal.</p>
        <p>This ceremony is held in the depth of winter. <tone emotion="pride">But, by the words we
                speak and the faces we show the world, we force the spring</tone>.</p>
        <p>A spring reborn in the world’s oldest democracy, that brings forth the vision and courage
            to reinvent America.</p>
        <p>
            <tone rhetoric="appeal_to_past">When our Founders boldly declared America’s
                independence</tone> to the world and <value type="religion">our purposes to the
                Almighty</value>, <value type="progress">they knew America, to endure, would have to
                change</value>. </p>
        <p>Not change for change’s sake, but change to preserve America’s ideals—life, liberty, the
            pursuit of happiness. Though we march to the music of our time, our mission is
            timeless.</p>
        <p>Each generation of Americans must define what it means to be an American.</p>
        <p>On behalf of our Nation, I salute my predecessor, President Bush, for his half-century of
            service to America. <tone emotion="triumph">And I thank the millions of men and women
                whose steadfastness and sacrifice triumphed over depression, fascism, and
                communism</tone>.</p>
        <p>Today, a generation raised in the shadows of the cold war assumes new responsibilities in
            a world warmed by the sunshine of freedom but <tone emotion="stress">threatened still by
                ancient hatreds and new plagues</tone>.</p>
        <p><tone emotion="pride">Raised in unrivaled prosperity, we inherit an economy that is still
                the world’s strongest</tone>, <policy economy="business">but is weakened by business
                failures, stagnant wages</policy>, <value type="equality">increasing inequality, and
                deep divisions among our own people</value>.</p>
        <p><tone rhetoric="appeal_to_past">When George Washington first took the oath I have just
                sworn to uphold, news traveled slowly across the land by horseback and across the
                ocean by boat</tone>. Now, the sights and sounds of this ceremony are broadcast
            instantaneously to billions around the world.</p>
        <p>Communications and commerce are global; investment is mobile; technology is almost
            magical; and ambition for a better life is now universal. We earn our livelihood in
            America today in peaceful competition with people all across the Earth.</p>
        <p>Profound and powerful forces are shaking and remaking our world, <value type="progress"
                >and the urgent question of our time is whether we can make change our friend and
                not our enemy</value>.</p>
        <p>This new world has already enriched the lives of millions of Americans who are able to
            compete and win in it. <value type="equality">But when most people are working harder
                for less; when others cannot work at all</value>; <policy health="health care">when
                the cost of health care devastates families and threatens to bankrupt our
                enterprises</policy>, great and small; <policy crime="safety">when the fear of crime
                robs law-abiding citizens of their freedom</policy>; <value type="equality">and when
                millions of poor children cannot even imagine the lives we are calling them to
                lead</value>—we have not made change our friend.</p>
        <p><tone emotion="stress">We know we have to face hard truths and take strong steps. But we
                have not done so. Instead, we have drifted, and that drifting has eroded our
                resources, fractured our economy, and shaken our confidence</tone>.</p>
        <p><tone emotion="optimistic">Though our challenges are fearsome, so are our strengths.
                Americans have ever been a restless, questing, hopeful people</tone>. And we must
            bring to our task today the vision and will of those who came before us.</p>
        <p><tone rhetoric="appeal_to_past">From our Revolution to the Civil War, to the Great
                Depression, to the civil rights movement</tone>, <tone emotion="optimistic">our
                people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the
                pillars of our history</tone>.</p>
        <p><tone rhetoric="appeal_to_past">Thomas Jefferson believed that to preserve the very
                foundations of our Nation</tone>, <value type="progress">we would need dramatic
                change from time to time</value>. Well, my fellow Americans, this is our time. Let
            us embrace it.</p>
        <p>Our democracy must be not only the envy of the world but the engine of our own renewal.
                <tone emotion="optimistic">There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured
                by what is right with America</tone>.</p>
        <p><value type="action">So today, we pledge an end to the era of deadlock and drift—and a
                new season of American renewal has begun</value>.</p>
        <p>To renew America, we must be bold.</p>
        <p><value type="progress">We must do what no generation has had to do before</value>.
                <policy economy="jobs">We must invest more in our own people, in their jobs and in
                their future, and at the same time cut our massive debt</policy>. And we must do so
            in a world in which we must compete for every opportunity.</p>
        <p><tone emotion="stress">It will not be easy; it will require sacrifice</tone>. <tone
                emotion="optimistic">But it can be done, and done fairly, not choosing sacrifice for
                its own sake, but for our own sake</tone>. We must provide for our Nation the way a
            family provides for its children.</p>
        <p><tone rhetoric="appeal_to_past">Our Founders saw themselves in the light of posterity. We
                can do no less</tone>. Anyone who has ever watched a child’s eyes wander into sleep
            knows what posterity is. Posterity is the world to come—the world for whom we hold our
            ideals, from whom we have borrowed our planet, and to whom we bear sacred
            responsibility.</p>
        <p>We must do what America does best: offer more opportunity to all and demand more
            responsibility from all.</p>
        <p><value type="action">It is time to break the bad habit of expecting something for
                nothing</value>, from our Government or from each other. Let us all take more
            responsibility, not only for ourselves and our families but for our communities and our
            country.</p>
        <p>To renew America, <value type="democracy">we must revitalize our democracy</value>.</p>
        <p>This beautiful Capital, like every capital since the dawn of civilization, is often a
            place of intrigue and calculation. <tone emotion="provoking">Powerful people maneuver
                for position and worry endlessly about who is in and who is out, who is up and who
                is down, forgetting those people whose toil and sweat sends us here and pays our
                way</tone>.</p>
        <p>Americans deserve better. <tone emotion="optimistic">And in this city, there are people
                who want to do better</tone>. And so I say to all of you here, let us resolve to
            reform our politics, <value type="equality">so that power and privilege no longer shout
                down the voice of the people</value>. Let us put aside personal advantage so that we
            can feel the pain and see the promise of America.</p>
        <p><tone rhetoric="appeal_to_past">Let us resolve to make our Government a place for what
                Franklin Roosevelt called “bold, persistent experimentation,” a government for our
                tomorrows, not our yesterdays</tone>.</p>
        <p><tone emotion="provoking">Let us give this Capital back to the people to whom it
                belongs</tone>.</p>
        <p><policy foreign="internationalism">To renew America, we must meet challenges abroad as well
                as at home. There is no longer a clear division between what is foreign and what is
                domestic</policy>—<policy economy="global_economy">the world economy</policy>,
                <policy environment="preservation">the world environment</policy>, <policy
                health="public_health">the world AIDS crisis</policy>, <policy military="war">the
                world arms race</policy>, they affect us all.</p>
        <p>Today, as an old order passes, the new world is more free but less stable. <tone
                emotion="stress">Communism’s collapse has called forth old animosities and new
                dangers</tone>. <policy foreign="internationalism">Clearly America must continue to lead
                the world we did so much to make</policy>.</p>
        <p>While America rebuilds at home, we will not shrink from the challenges, nor fail to seize
            the opportunities, of this new world. <policy foreign="internationalism">Together with our
                friends and allies, we will work to shape change, lest it engulf us</policy>.</p>
        <p><policy foreign="internationalism">When our vital interests are challenged, or the will and
                conscience of the international community is defied, we will act—with peaceful
                diplomacy whenever possible, with force when necessary</policy>. <policy
                military="soldiers">The brave Americans serving our Nation today in the Persian
                Gulf, in Somalia, and wherever else they stand are testament to our
            resolve</policy>.</p>
        <p><tone emotion="pride">But our greatest strength is the power of our ideas, which are
                still new in many lands. Across the world, we see them embraced—and we
                rejoice</tone>. <policy foreign="internationalism">Our hopes, our hearts, and our hands,
                are with those on every continent who are building democracy and freedom. Their
                cause is America’s cause</policy>.</p>
        <p><value type="progress">The American people have summoned the change we celebrate
                today</value>. You have raised your voices in an unmistakable chorus. You have cast
            your votes in historic numbers. And you have changed the face of the Congress, the
            Presidency, and the political process itself.</p>
        <p>Yes, you, my fellow Americans, have forced the spring.</p>
        <p>Now, we must do the work the season demands.</p>
        <p>To that work I now turn, with all the authority of my office. I ask the Congress to join
            with me. But no President, no Congress, no government, can undertake this mission
            alone.</p>
        <p>My fellow Americans, you, too, must play your part in our renewal.</p>
        <p><value type="unity">I challenge a new generation of young Americans to a season of
                service—to act on your idealism by helping troubled children, keeping company with
                those in need, reconnecting our torn communities</value>. There is so much to be
            done—enough indeed for millions of others who are still young in spirit to give of
            themselves in service, too.</p>
        <p><value type="unity">In serving, we recognize a simple but powerful truth: We need each
                other. And we must care for one another</value>.</p>
        <p>Today, we do more than celebrate America; we rededicate ourselves to the very idea of
            America: An idea born in revolution and renewed through two centuries of challenge; An
            idea tempered by the knowledge that, but for fate, <value type="unity">we—the fortunate
                and the unfortunate—might have been each other; An idea ennobled by the faith that
                our Nation can summon from its myriad diversity the deepest measure of
            unity</value>; An idea infused with the conviction that <value type="progress">America’s
                long heroic journey must go forever upward</value>.</p>
        <p>And so, my fellow Americans, as we stand at the edge of the 21st century, <value
                type="progress">let us begin anew with energy and hope</value>, with faith and
            discipline, and let us work until our work is done. <value type="religion">The Scripture
                says “And let us not be weary in well-doing, for in due season, we shall reap, if we
                faint not.”</value></p>
        <p>From this joyful mountaintop of celebration, we hear a call to service in the valley.</p>
        <p>We have heard the trumpets. We have changed the guard. <value type="religion">And
                now—each in our own way, and with God’s help—we must answer the call</value>.</p>
        <p> Thank you, and <value type="religion">God bless you all</value>. </p>
