        <p>Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives: </p>

        <p>Among the vicissitudes incident to life no event could have filled me with <tone
                emotion="stressed">greater anxieties</tone> than that of which the notification was
            transmitted by your order, and received on the 14th day of the present month. On the one
            hand, I was summoned by my country, <tone emotion="proud">whose voice I can never hear
                but with veneration and love</tone>, from a retreat which I had chosen with the
                <tone emotion="proud">fondest predilection, and, in my flattering hopes</tone>, with
            an immutable decision, as the asylum of my declining years—a retreat which was rendered
            every day more necessary as well as more dear to me by the addition of habit to
            inclination, and of <tone emotion="stressed">frequent interruptions in my health</tone> to
            the gradual waste committed on it by time. On the other hand, the magnitude and
            difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to
            awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into
            his qualifications, could not but <tone emotion="stressed">overwhelm with despondence one
                who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of
                civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own
                deficiencies</tone>. In this conflict of emotions all I dare aver is that it has
            been my faithful study to collect my duty from a just appreciation of every circumstance
            by which it might be affected. All I dare hope is that if, in executing this task,I have
            been too much swayed by a grateful remembrance of former instances, or by an
            affectionate sensibility to this transcendent proof of the confidence of my
            fellow-citizens, and have thence too little <value type="humility">consulted my
                incapacity as well as disinclination for the weighty and untried cares before me, my
                error will be palliated by the motives which mislead me, and its consequences be
                judged by my country with some share of the partiality in which they
                originated</value>.</p>

        <p>Such being the impressions under which I have, in obedience to the public summons,
            repaired to the present station, it would be peculiarly improper to omit in this first
            official act my fervent supplications to that <value type="religion">Almighty
                Being</value> who rules over the universe, who presides in the councils of nations,
            and whose providential aids can supply every human defect, that <value
                type="religion">His</value> benediction may consecrate to the
            liberties and happiness of the people of the United
            States a Government instituted by themselves for these essential purposes, and may
            enable every instrument employed in its administration to execute with success the
            functions allotted to his charge. In tendering this homage to the <value
                type="religion">Great Author</value> of every public and private good, I assure
            myself that it <value type="humility">expresses your sentiments not less than my
                own, nor those of my fellow-citizens at large less than either</value>. No people
            can be bound to acknowledge and adore the <value type="religion">Invisible Hand</value>
            which conducts the affairs of men more than those of the United States. Every step by
            which they have advanced to the character of an independent nation seems to have been
            distinguished by some token of <value type="religion">providential agency</value>;
            and in the important revolution just accomplished in the system of their united
            government the tranquil deliberations and voluntary consent of so many distinct
            communities from which the event has resulted can not be compared with the means by
            which most governments have been established without some return of pious gratitude,
                <value type="humility">along with an humble anticipation of the future blessings
                which the past seem to presage</value>. These reflections, arising out of the <tone
                emotion ="stressed">present crisis</tone>, have forced themselves too strongly on my
            mind to be suppressed. <value type="unity">You will join with me</value>, I trust,
            in thinking that there are none under the influence of which the proceedings of a <value
                type="liberty">new and free</value> government can more auspiciously commence. </p>

        <p>By the article establishing the executive department it is made the duty of the President
            “to recommend to your consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and
            expedient.” The circumstances under which I now meet you will acquit me from entering
            into that subject further than to refer to the great constitutional charter under which
            you are assembled, and which, in defining your powers, designates the objects to which
            your attention is to be given. It will be more consistent with those circumstances, and
            far more congenial with the feelings which actuate me, to substitute, in place of a
            recommendation of particular measures, the tribute that is due to the talents, the
            rectitude, and the <value type="patriotism">patriotism</value> which adorn the
            characters selected to devise and adopt them. In these honorable qualifications I behold
            the surest pledges that as on one side <value type ="equality">no local prejudices
                or attachments, no separate views nor party animosities, will misdirect the
                comprehensive and equal eye which ought to watch over this great assemblage of
                communities and interests, so, on another, that the foundation of our national
                policy will be laid in the pure and immutable principles of private morality, and
                the preeminence of free government be exemplified by all the attributes which can
                win the affections of its citizens and command the respect of the world</value>.
                <tone emotion="proud">I dwell on this prospect with every satisfaction which an
                ardent love for my country can inspire</tone>, <tone emotion="optimistic">since there
                is no truth more thoroughly established than that there exists in the economy and
                course of nature an indissoluble union between virtue and happiness; between duty
                and advantage; between the genuine maxims of an honest and magnanimous policy and
                the solid rewards of public prosperity and felicity;</tone> since we ought to be no
            less persuaded that the propitious smiles of <value type="religion">Heaven</value>
            can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right
            which <value type="religion">Heaven</value> itself has ordained; and since the
            preservation of the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model of government are justly considered,
            perhaps, as deeply, as finally, staked on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the
            American people. </p>

        <p>Besides the ordinary objects submitted to your care, it will remain with <value
                type="democracy">your judgment to decide</value> how far an exercise of the
            occasional power delegated by the <tone rhetoric ="appeal to history">fifth article of the Constitution</tone> is rendered
            expedient at the present juncture by the <tone emotion="stressed">nature of objections
                which have been urged against the system, or by the degree of inquietude which has
                given birth to them</tone>. Instead of undertaking particular recommendations on
            this subject, in which I could be guided by no lights derived from official
            opportunities, I shall again give way to <value type="democracy">my entire
                confidence in your discernment and pursuit of the public good</value>; for I assure
            myself that whilst you carefully avoid every alteration which might endanger the
            benefits of an united and effective government, or which ought to await the future
            lessons of experience, a reverence for the characteristic rights of <value
                type="democracy">freemen and a regard for the public harmony</value>
            will sufficiently influence your deliberations on the question how far the former can be
            impregnably fortified or the latter be safely and advantageously promoted. </p>

        <p>To the foregoing observations I have one to add, which will be most properly addressed to
            the House of Representatives. It concerns myself, and will therefore be as brief as
            possible. When I was first honored with a call into the service of my country, then on
            the eve of an arduous struggle for its liberties, the light in which I contemplated my
            duty required that <value type="humility">I should renounce every pecuniary
                compensation</value>. From this resolution I have in no instance departed; and being
            still under the impressions which produced it, I must decline as inapplicable to myself
            any share in the personal emoluments which may be indispensably included in a permanent
            provision for the executive department, and must accordingly <value type="religion"
                >pray</value> that the pecuniary estimates for the station in which I am placed may
            during my continuance in it be limited to such actual expenditures as the public good
            may be thought to require. </p>

        <p> Having thus imparted to you my sentiments as they have been awakened by the occasion
            which brings us together, I shall take my present leave; but not without resorting once
            more to the benign <value type="religion">Parent of the Human Race</value> in
            humble supplication that, since <value type="religion">He</value> has been pleased to
            favor the American people with opportunities for deliberating in perfect
            tranquillity,and dispositions for deciding with unparalleled unanimity on a form of
            government for the security of their union and the advancement of their happiness, so
                <value type="religion">His</value> divine blessing may be equally conspicuous in
            the enlarged views, the temperate consultations, and the wise measures on which the
            success of this Government must depend. </p>
