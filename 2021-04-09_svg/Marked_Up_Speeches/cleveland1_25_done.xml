        <p>Fellow-Citizens:</p>
        <p>In the presence of this vast assemblage of my countrymen I am about to supplement and
            seal by the oath which I shall take the manifestation of the will of a great and free
            people. In the exercise of their power and right of self-government they have committed
            to one of their fellow-citizens a supreme and sacred trust, and he here consecrates
            himself to their service.</p>
        <p><tone emotion="humble">This impressive ceremony adds little to the solemn sense of
                responsibility with which I contemplate the duty I owe to all the people of the
                land. Nothing can relieve me from anxiety lest by any act of mine their interests
                may suffer, and nothing is needed to strengthen my resolution to engage every
                faculty and effort in the promotion of their welfare.</tone></p>
        <p>Amid the din of party strife the people’s choice was made, but its attendant
            circumstances have demonstrated anew the strength and safety of a government by the
            people. <value type="democracy">In each succeeding year it more clearly appears that our
                democratic principle needs no apology, and that in its fearless and faithful
                application is to be found the surest guaranty of good government.</value></p>
        <p>But the best results in the operation of a government wherein <value type="unity">every citizen has a share
            largely depend upon a proper limitation of purely partisan zeal</value> and effort and a correct
            appreciation of the time when the heat of the partisan should be merged in the <value
                type="patriotism">patriotism of the citizen.</value></p>
        <p><value type="democracy">To-day the executive branch of the Government is transferred to new
                keeping. But this is still the Government of all the people, and it should be none
                the less an object of their affectionate solicitude.</value> At this hour the
            animosities of political strife, the bitterness of partisan defeat, and the exultation
            of partisan triumph should be supplanted by an ungrudging acquiescence in the popular
            will and a sober, conscientious concern for the general weal. Moreover, <value type="unity">if from this
                hour we cheerfully and honestly abandon all sectional prejudice and distrust,</value> and
            determine, with manly confidence in one another, to work out harmoniously the
            achievements of our national destiny, we shall deserve to realize all the benefits which
            our happy form of government can bestow.</p>
        <p>On this auspicious occasion we may well renew the pledge of our devotion to the
            Constitution, which, <tone rhetoric="appeal_to_history">launched by the founders of the
                Republic and consecrated by their prayers and patriotic devotion,</tone> has for
            almost a century borne the hopes and the aspirations of a great people through
            prosperity and peace and through the shock of foreign conflicts and the perils of
            domestic strife and vicissitudes.</p>
        <p><tone rhetoric="appeal_to_history">By the Father of his Country our Constitution was commended for adoption as “the result
            of a spirit of amity and mutual concession.” </tone><value type="unity">In that same spirit it should be
            administered, in order to promote the lasting welfare of the country and to secure the
            full measure of its priceless benefits to us and to those who will succeed to the
            blessings of our national life.</value> The large variety of diverse and competing interests
            subject to Federal control, persistently seeking the recognition of their claims, need
            give us no fear that “the greatest good to the greatest number” will fail to be
            accomplished if in the halls of national legislation that spirit of amity and mutual
            concession shall prevail in which the Constitution had its birth. If this involves the
            surrender or postponement of private interests and the abandonment of local advantages,
            compensation will be found in the assurance that the common interest is subserved and
            the general welfare advanced.</p>
        <p><tone emotion="humble">In the discharge of my official duty I shall endeavor to be guided by a just and
            unstrained.</tone> construction of the Constitution, a careful observance of the distinction
            between the powers granted to the Federal Government and those reserved to the States or
            to the people, and by a cautious appreciation of those functions which by the
            Constitution and laws have been especially assigned to the executive branch of the
            Government.</p>
        <p><tone emotion="humble">But he who takes the oath today to preserve, protect, and defend
                the Constitution of the United States only assumes the solemn obligation which every
                patriotic citizen—on the farm, in the workshop, in the busy marts of trade, and
                everywhere—should share with him. The Constitution which prescribes his oath, my
                countrymen, is yours;</tone> the Government you have chosen him to administer for a
            time is yours; the suffrage which executes the will of freemen is yours; the laws and
            the entire scheme of our civil rule, from the town meeting to the State capitals and the
            national capital, is yours. Your every voter, as surely as your Chief Magistrate, under
            the same high sanction, though in a different sphere, exercises a public trust. Nor is
            this all. Every citizen owes to the country a vigilant watch and close scrutiny of its
            public servants and a fair and reasonable estimate of their fidelity and usefulness.
            Thus is the people’s will impressed upon the whole framework of our civil
            polity—municipal, State, and Federal; and this is the price of our liberty and the
            inspiration of our faith in the Republic.</p>
        <p>
            <policy economy="budget">It is the duty of those serving the people in public
                place to closely limit public expenditures to the actual needs of the Government
                economically administered, because this bounds the right of the Government to exact
                tribute from the earnings of labor or the property of the citizen, and because
                public extravagance begets extravagance among the people.</policy> We should never
            be ashamed of the simplicity and prudential economies which are best suited to the
            operation of a republican form of government and most compatible with the mission of the
            American people. <tone emotion="humble">Those who are selected for a limited time to manage public affairs are
            still of the people, and may do much by their example to encourage, consistently with
            the dignity of their official functions, that plain way of life which among their
            fellow-citizens aids integrity and promotes thrift and prosperity.</tone></p>
        <p><tone emotion="proud">The genius of our institutions, the needs of our people in their
                home life, and the attention which is demanded for the settlement and development of
                the resources of our vast territory dictate the scrupulous avoidance of any
                departure from that foreign policy commended by the history, the traditions, and the
                prosperity of our Republic.</tone> <value type="liberty">It is the policy of independence, favored by our
                    position and defended by our known love of justice and by our power.</value> It is the policy of
            peace suitable to our interests. <policy foreign="isolationism">It is the policy of neutrality, rejecting any share in
                foreign broils and ambitions upon other continents and repelling their intrusion here.</policy>
            <tone rhetoric="appeal_to_history">It is the policy of Monroe and of Washington and Jefferson—”Peace, commerce, and honest
                friendship with all nations; entangling alliance with none.”</tone></p>
        <p>A due regard for the interests and prosperity of all the people demands that our finances
            shall be established upon such a sound and sensible basis as shall secure the safety and
            confidence of business interests and make the wage of labor sure and steady, and that
            our system of <policy economy="taxes">revenue shall be so adjusted as to relieve
                the people of unnecessary taxation,</policy> having a due regard to the interests of
            capital invested and workingmen employed in American industries, and preventing the
            accumulation of a surplus in the Treasury to tempt extravagance and waste.</p>
        <p>Care for the property of the nation and for the needs of future settlers requires that
            the public domain should be protected from purloining schemes and unlawful
            occupation.</p>
        <p><policy civil_rights="native_american">The conscience of the people demands that the
                Indians within our boundaries shall be fairly and honestly treated as wards of the
                Government and their education and civilization promoted with a view to their
                ultimate citizenship,</policy> and that polygamy in the Territories, destructive of
            the family relation and offensive to the moral sense of the civilized world, shall be
            repressed.</p>
        <p><policy foreign="immigration">The laws should be rigidly enforced which prohibit
                the immigration of a servile class to compete with American labor, with no intention
                of acquiring citizenship, and bringing with them and retaining habits and customs
                repugnant to our civilization.</policy></p>
        <p>The people demand reform in the administration of the Government and the application of
            business principles to public affairs. As a means to this end,<policy
                government="civil_service_reform"> civil-service reform should be in good faith
                enforced.</policy> Our citizens have the right to protection from the incompetency
            of public employees who hold their places solely as the reward of partisan service, and
            from the corrupting influence of those who promise and the vicious methods of those who
            expect such rewards; and those who worthily seek public employment have the right to
            insist that merit and competency shall be recognized instead of party subserviency or
            the surrender of honest political belief.</p>
        <p><value type="equality">In the administration of a government pledged to do equal and exact justice to all men</value>
            there should be no pretext for anxiety touching the protection of the <policy civil_rights="equal_protection">freedmen in their
            rights or their security in the enjoyment of their privileges under the Constitution and
            its amendments.</policy> All discussion as to their fitness for the place accorded to them as
            American citizens is idle and unprofitable except as it suggests the necessity for their
            improvement. <policy civil_rights="equal_protection">The fact that they are citizens entitles
                them to all the rights due to that relation and charges them with all its duties,
                obligations, and responsibilities.</policy></p>
        <p>These topics and the constant and ever-varying wants of an active and enterprising
            population may well receive the attention and the <value type="patriotism">patriotic endeavor of all who make and
                execute the Federal law.</value> <tone emotion="pramatic">Our duties are practical and call for industrious application,
            an intelligent perception of the claims of public office, and, above all, a firm
            determination, by united action, to secure to all the people of the land the full
            benefits of the best form of government ever vouchsafed to man.</tone> <value type="religion">And let us not trust to
            human effort alone, but humbly acknowledging the power and goodness of Almighty God, who
            presides over the destiny of nations, and who has at all times been revealed in our
            country’s history, let us invoke His aid and His blessings upon our labors.</value></p>
