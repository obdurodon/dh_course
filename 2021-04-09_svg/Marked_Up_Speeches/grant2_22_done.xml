        <p>Fellow-Citizens:</p>
        <p>Under Providence I have been called a second time to act as Executive over this great
            nation. It has been my endeavor in the past to maintain all the laws, and, so far as lay
            in my power, to act for the best interests of the whole people. My best efforts will be
            given in the same direction in the future, aided, I trust, by my four years' experience
            in the office.</p>
        <p>When my first term of the office of Chief Executive began, the country had not recovered
            from the effects of a great internal revolution, and three of the former States of the
            Union had not been restored to their Federal relations.</p>
        <p>It seemed to me wise that no new questions should be raised so long as that condition of
            affairs existed. Therefore the past four years, so far as I could control events, have
            been consumed in the effort to restore <value type="security">harmony,</value> public
            credit, commerce, and all the arts of peace and progress. <value type="democracy">It is
                my firm conviction that the civilized world is tending toward republicanism, or
                government by the people through their chosen representatives,</value> and that our
            own great Republic is destined to be the guiding star to all others.</p>
        <p>Under our Republic we support an army less than that of any European power of any
            standing and a navy less than that of either of at least five of them. There could be no
            extension of territory on the continent which would call for an increase of this force,
            but rather might such extension enable us to diminish it.</p>
        <p>The theory of government changes with general progress. Now that the telegraph is made
            available for communicating thought, together with rapid transit by steam, all parts of
            a continent are made contiguous for all purposes of government, and communication
            between the extreme limits of the country made easier than it was throughout the old
            thirteen States at the beginning of our national existence.</p>
        <p>The effects of the late civil strife have been to free the slave and make him a citizen.
                <policy civil_rights="voting">Yet he is not possessed of the civil rights which
                citizenship should carry with it.</policy> This is wrong, and should be corrected.
            To this correction I stand committed, so far as Executive influence can avail.</p>
        <p><policy civil_rights="education">Social equality is not a subject to be legislated upon, nor
                shall I ask that anything be done to advance the social status of the colored man,
                except to give him a fair chance to develop what there is good in him, give him
                access to the schools,</policy> and when he travels let him feel assured that his
            conduct will regulate the treatment and fare he will receive.</p>
        <p>
            <value type="unity">The States lately at war with the General Government are now
                happily rehabilitated, and no Executive control is exercised in any one of them that
                would not be exercised in any other State under like circumstances.</value>
        </p>
        <p>
            <policy government="statehood">In the first year of the past Administration the proposition
                came up for the admission of Santo Domingo as a Territory of the Union. It was not a
                question of my seeking, but was a proposition from the people of Santo Domingo, and
                which I entertained. I believe now, as I did then, that it was for the best interest
                of this country, for the people of Santo Domingo, and all concerned that the
                proposition should be received favorably. It was, however, rejected
                constitutionally, and therefore the subject was never brought up again by
                me.</policy>
        </p>
        <p>In future, while I hold my present office, the subject of acquisition of territory must
            have the support of the people before I will recommend any proposition looking to such
            acquisition. I say here, however, that I do not share in the apprehension held by many
            as to the danger of governments becoming weakened and destroyed by reason of their
            extension of territory. Commerce, education, and rapid transit of thought and matter by
            telegraph and steam have changed all this. <value type="progress">Rather do I believe
                that our Great Maker is preparing the world, in His own good time, to become one
                nation, speaking one language, and when armies and navies will be no longer
                required.</value></p>
        <p><value type="unity">My efforts in the future will be directed to the restoration of good
                feeling between the different sections of our common country;</value><policy
                economy="currency"> to the restoration of our currency to a fixed value as
                compared with the world's standard of values—gold—and, if possible, to a par with
                it;</policy> to the construction of cheap routes of transit throughout the land, to
            the end that the products of all may find a market and leave a living remuneration to
            the producer; <policy foreign="cooperation">to the maintenance of friendly relations with all our neighbors and with
                distant nations;</policy> to the reestablishment of our commerce and share in the carrying trade
            upon the ocean; to the encouragement of such manufacturing industries as can be
            economically pursued in this country, to the end that the exports of home products and
            industries may pay for our imports—the only sure method of returning to and permanently
            maintaining a specie basis; to the elevation of labor; and, by a humane course, <policy
                civil_rights="native_american">to bring the aborigines of the country under the benign
                influences of education and civilization.</policy> It is either this or war of
            extermination: Wars of extermination, engaged in by people pursuing commerce and all
            industrial pursuits, are expensive even against the weakest people, and are demoralizing
            and wicked. Our superiority of strength and advantages of civilization should make us
            lenient toward the Indian. The wrong inflicted upon him should be taken into account and
            the balance placed to his credit. <policy civil_rights="native_american">The moral view of the question should be considered
            and the question asked, Can not the Indian be made a useful and productive member of
            society by proper teaching and treatment? If the effort is made in good faith, we will
            stand better before the civilized nations of the earth and in our own consciences for
            having made it.</policy></p>
        <p>All these things are not to be accomplished by one individual, but they will receive my
            support and such recommendations to Congress as will in my judgment best serve to carry
            them into effect. I beg your support and encouragement.</p>
        <p><policy government="civil_service_reform">It has been, and is, my earnest desire to correct abuses that have grown up in the civil
            service of the country.</policy> To secure this reformation rules regulating methods of
            appointment and promotions were established and have been tried. My efforts for such
            reformation shall be continued to the best of my judgment. The spirit of the rules
            adopted will be maintained.</p>
        <p><tone emotion="humble">I acknowledge before this assemblage, representing, as it does, every section of our
            country, the obligation I am under to my countrymen for the great honor they have
            conferred on me by returning me to the highest office within their gift, and the further
            obligation resting on me to render to them the best services within my power.</tone> This I
            promise, looking forward with the greatest anxiety to the day when I shall be released
            from responsibilities that at times are almost overwhelming, and from which I have
            scarcely had a respite since the eventful firing upon Fort Sumter, in April, 1861, to
            the present day. My services were then tendered and accepted under the first call for
            troops growing out of that event.</p>
        <p>I did not ask for place or position, and was entirely without influence or the
            acquaintance of persons of influence, but was resolved to perform my part in a struggle
            threatening the very existence of the nation. I performed a conscientious duty, without
            asking promotion or command, and without a revengeful feeling toward any section or
            individual.</p>
        <p>Notwithstanding this, throughout the war, and from my candidacy for my present office in
            1868 to the close of the last Presidential campaign, I have been the subject of abuse
            and slander scarcely ever equaled in political history, which to-day I feel that I can
            afford to disregard in view of your verdict, which I gratefully accept as my
            vindication.</p>
