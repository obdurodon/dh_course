        <p>For myself and for our Nation, I want to thank my predecessor for all he has done to
                <value type="unity">heal our land.</value></p>

        <p>In this outward and physical ceremony we attest once again to the inner and <value type="religion">spiritual
            strength of our Nation.</value> As my high school teacher, Miss Julia Coleman, used to say: “We
            must adjust to changing times and still hold to unchanging principles.”</p>

        <p> <tone rhetoric="appeal_to_history">Here before me is the Bible used in the inauguration of our first President,</tone> in 1789,
            and I have just taken the oath of office on the Bible my mother gave me a few years ago,
            opened to <value type="religion">a timeless admonition from the ancient prophet Micah: “He hath showed thee, O
            man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love
            mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.” (Micah 6:8) </value></p>

        <p>This inauguration ceremony marks a new beginning, a new dedication within our Government,
            and a new spirit among us all. A President may sense and proclaim that new spirit, <value type="democracy">but
                only a people can provide it.</value></p>

        <p><tone rhetoric="appeal_to_history">Two centuries ago our Nation’s birth</tone> was a <value type="liberty">milestone in the long
                quest for freedom,</value> but the bold and brilliant dream which excited the
            founders of this Nation still awaits its consummation. I have no new dream to set forth
            today, but rather urge a fresh faith in the old dream.</p>

        <p><tone rhetoric="appeal_to_history">Ours was the first society</tone> <value type="religion">openly to define itself in
            terms of both spirituality</value><value type="liberty"> and of human liberty.</value> It is that unique
            self-definition which has given us an exceptional appeal, but it also imposes on us a
            special obligation, to take on those moral duties which, when assumed, seem invariably
            to be in our own best interests.</p>

        <p>You have given me a great responsibility—to stay close to you, to be worthy of you, and
            to exemplify what you are. Let us create together a <value type="unity">new national
                spirit of unity and trust.</value> <tone emotion="humble">Your strength can compensate for my weakness,
                    and your wisdom can help to minimize my mistakes.</tone></p>

        <p><value type="unity">Let us learn together and laugh together and work together and pray
                together, confident that in the end we will triumph together in the right.</value>
            The American dream endures. We must once again have full faith in our country—and in one
            another.<value type="progress"> I believe America can be better. We can be even stronger than before.</value></p>

        <p>Let our recent mistakes bring a resurgent commitment to the basic principles of our
            Nation, for we know that if we despise our own government we have no future. <value type="unity">We recall
            in special times when we have stood briefly, but magnificently, united. In those times
            no prize was beyond our grasp.</value></p>

        <p><value type="progress">But we cannot dwell upon remembered glory.</value> We cannot afford to drift. We reject the
            prospect of failure or mediocrity or an inferior quality of life for any person.<tone emotion="pragmatic"> Our
                Government must at the same time be both competent and compassionate.</tone></p>

        <p>We have already found a high degree of personal liberty, and we are now struggling to
                <value type="equality">enhance equality of opportunity. Our commitment to human
                    rights must be absolute, our laws fair,</value> <policy environment="preservation">our natural beauty preserved;</policy> the powerful
                must not persecute the weak, and human dignity must be enhanced.</p>

        <p>We have learned that “more” is not necessarily “better,” <tone emotion="humble">that even our great Nation has
            its recognized limits,</tone> <tone emotion="humble">and that we can neither answer all questions
                nor solve all problems. We cannot afford to do everything, nor can we afford to lack
                boldness as we meet the future. So, together, in a spirit of individual sacrifice
                for the common good, we must simply do our best.</tone></p>

        <p>Our Nation can be strong abroad only if it is strong at home. And we know that the best
            way to enhance freedom in other lands is to demonstrate here that our democratic system
            is worthy of emulation. To be true to ourselves, we must be true to others. <policy foreign="pacifism">We will not
            behave in foreign places so as to violate our rules and standards here at home, for we
            know that the trust which our Nation earns is essential to our strength.</policy></p>

        <p><value type="liberty">The world itself is now dominated by a new spirit. Peoples more numerous and more
            politically aware are craving and now demanding their place in the sun—not just for the
            benefit of their own physical condition, but for basic human rights.</value></p>

        <p><value type="liberty">The passion for freedom is on the rise.</value> Tapping this new
            spirit, there can be no nobler nor more ambitious task for America to undertake on this
            day of a new beginning than to help shape a just and peaceful world that is truly
            humane.</p>

        <p><policy foreign="pacifism">We are a strong nation, and we will maintain strength so
                sufficient that it need not be proven in combat—a quiet strength based not merely on
                the size of an arsenal, but on the nobility of ideas.</policy> We will be ever
            vigilant and never vulnerable, and we will fight our wars against poverty, ignorance,
            and injustice—for those are the enemies against which our forces can be honorably
            marshaled. We are a purely idealistic Nation, but let no one confuse our idealism with
            weakness.</p>

        <p>Because we are free we can never be indifferent to the fate of freedom elsewhere. Our
            moral sense dictates a clearcut preference for these societies which share with us an
            abiding respect for individual human rights. We do not seek to intimidate, <value
                type="liberty">but it is clear that a world which others can dominate with impunity
                would be inhospitable to decency and a threat to the well-being of all
                people.</value></p>

        <p><policy military="nuclear_weapons"></policy>The world is still engaged in a massive armaments race designed to ensure continuing
            equivalent strength among potential adversaries. We pledge perseverance and wisdom in
            our efforts to limit the world’s armaments to those necessary for each nation’s own
            domestic safety.<policy military="nuclear_weapons"> And we will move this year a step toward our ultimate goal—the
                elimination of all nuclear weapons from this Earth.</policy> <tone emotion="stressed">We urge all other people to join us,
                    for success can mean life instead of death.</tone></p>

        <p><tone emotion="optimistic">Within us, the people of the United States, there is evident a
                serious and purposeful rekindling of confidence. And I join in the hope that when my
                time as your President has ended, people might say this about our Nation: —that we
                had remembered the words of Micah and renewed our search for humility, mercy, and
                justice;</tone> —that we had torn down the barriers that separated those of
            different race and region and religion, and where there had been mistrust, <value
                type="unity">built unity, with a respect for diversity;</value> —that we had found
            productive work for those able to perform it; —that we had strengthened the American
            family, which is the basis of our society; —that we had ensured respect for the law, and
            equal treatment under the law, for the weak and the powerful, for the rich and the poor;
            —and that we had enabled our people to be proud of their own Government once again.</p>

        <p>I would hope that the nations of the world might say that we had built a lasting peace,
            built not on weapons of war but on international policies which reflect our own most
            precious values.</p>

        <p>These are not just my goals, and they will not be my accomplishments, but the affirmation
            of our Nation’s continuing moral strength and our belief in an undiminished,
            ever-expanding American dream.</p>
