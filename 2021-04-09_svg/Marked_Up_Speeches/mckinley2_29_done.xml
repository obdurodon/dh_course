        <p>My Fellow-Citizens:</p>

        <p><policy economy="currency">When we assembled here on the 4th of March, 1897, there was great anxiety with regard to
            our currency and credit.</policy> None exists now. Then our Treasury receipts were inadequate to
            meet the current obligations of the Government. Now they are sufficient for all public
            needs, and we have a surplus instead of a deficit. Then I felt constrained to convene
            the Congress in extraordinary session to devise revenues to pay the ordinary expenses of
            the Government. <policy economy="taxes">Now I have the satisfaction to announce that the Congress just closed
                has reduced taxation in the sum of $41,000,000.</policy> Then there was deep solicitude because
            of the long depression in our manufacturing, mining, agricultural, and mercantile
            industries and the consequent distress of our laboring population. <tone emotion="optimistic">Now every avenue of
            production is crowded with activity, labor is well employed, and American products find
            good markets at home and abroad.</tone></p>

        <p>Our diversified productions, however, are increasing in such unprecedented volume as to
            admonish us of the necessity of still further enlarging our foreign markets by broader
            commercial relations. <policy economy="trade">For this purpose reciprocal trade arrangements with other nations
                should in liberal spirit be carefully cultivated and promoted.</policy></p>

        <p>The national verdict of 1896 has for the most part been executed. Whatever remains
            unfulfilled is a continuing obligation resting with undiminished force upon the
            Executive and the Congress. But fortunate as our condition is, its permanence can only
            be assured by sound business methods and strict economy in national administration and
            legislation. <tone emotion="stern">We should not permit our great prosperity to lead us to reckless ventures</tone>
            in business or profligacy in public expenditures. While the Congress determines the
            objects and the sum of appropriations, the officials of the executive departments are
            responsible for honest and faithful disbursement, and it should be their constant care
            to avoid waste and extravagance. <policy government="civil_service_reform">Honesty, capacity, and industry are nowhere more
            indispensable than in public employment. These should be fundamental requisites to
            original appointment and the surest guaranties against removal.</policy></p>

        <p>Four years ago we stood on the brink of war without the people knowing it and without any
            preparation or effort at preparation for the impending peril. <policy military="war">I did all that in honor
            could be done to avert the war, but without avail. It became inevitable; and the
            Congress at its first regular session, without party division, provided money in
            anticipation of the crisis and in preparation to meet it.</policy> It came. The result was
            signally favorable to American arms and in the highest degree honorable to the
            Government. It imposed upon us obligations from which we cannot escape and from which it
            would be dishonorable to seek escape. We are now at peace with the world, <policy foreign="cooperation">and it is my
            fervent prayer that if differences arise between us and other powers they may be settled
            by peaceful arbitration and that hereafter we may be spared the horrors of war.</policy></p>

        <p>Intrusted by the people for a second time
                with the office of President, <tone emotion="humble">I enter upon its administration appreciating the great
                responsibilities which attach to this renewed honor and commission, promising
                unreserved devotion on my part to their faithful discharge</tone> <value type="religion">and reverently invoking
                for my guidance the direction and favor of Almighty
                God.</value> I should shrink from the duties this day assumed if I did not
            feel that in their performance I should have the co-operation of the wise and patriotic
            men of all parties. It encourages me for the great task which I now undertake to believe
            that those who voluntarily committed to me the trust imposed upon the Chief Executive of
            the Republic will give to me generous support in my duties to “preserve, protect, and
            defend, the Constitution of the United States” and to “care that the laws be faithfully
            executed.” <value type="democracy">The national purpose is indicated through a national election. It is the
                constitutional method of ascertaining the public will.</value> When once it is registered it is
            a law to us all, and faithful observance should follow its decrees.</p>

        <p><tone emotion="proud">Strong hearts and helpful hands are needed, and, fortunately, we have them in every part
            of our beloved country.</tone> <value type="unity">We are reunited.</value> Sectionalism has disappeared. <tone rhetoric="appeal_to_history">Division on
                public questions can no longer be traced by the war maps of 1861.</tone> These old differences
            less and less disturb the judgment. Existing problems demand the thought and quicken the
            conscience of the country, and the responsibility for their presence, as well as for
            their righteous settlement, rests upon us all—no more upon me than upon you. <value type="patriotism">There are
                some national questions in the solution of which patriotism should exclude partisanship.</value>
            Magnifying their difficulties will not take them off our hands nor facilitate their
            adjustment. Distrust of the capacity, integrity, and high purposes of the American
            people will not be an inspiring theme for future political contests. Dark pictures and
            gloomy forebodings are worse than useless. These only becloud, they do not help to point
            the way of safety and honor. “Hope maketh not ashamed.” The prophets of evil were not
            the builders of the Republic, nor in its crises since have they saved or served it. <value type="religion">The
            faith of the fathers was a mighty force in its creation, and the faith of their
            descendants has wrought its progress and furnished its defenders.</value> They are
            obstructionists who despair, and who would destroy confidence in the ability of our
            people to solve wisely and for civilization the mighty problems resting upon them. The
            American people, <value type="liberty">intrenched in freedom at home, take their love for it with them
                wherever they go,</value> and they reject as mistaken and unworthy the doctrine that we lose our
            own liberties by securing the enduring foundations of liberty to others. <tone emotion="optimistic">Our
            institutions will not deteriorate by extension, and our sense of justice will not abate
            under tropic suns in distant seas.</tone> As heretofore, so hereafter will the nation
            demonstrate its fitness to administer any new estate which events devolve upon it, and
            in the fear of God will “take occasion by the hand and make the bounds of freedom wider
            yet.” If there are those among us who would make our way more difficult, we must not be
            disheartened, but the more earnestly dedicate ourselves to the task upon which we have
            rightly entered. <value type="progress">The path of progress is seldom smooth.</value> New things are often found hard
            to do. <tone rhetoric="appeal_to_history">Our fathers found them so. We find them so. They are inconvenient. They cost us
            something. But are we not made better for the effort and sacrifice, and are not those we
            serve lifted up and blessed?</tone></p>

        <p><tone emotion="proud">We will be consoled, too, with the fact that opposition has confronted every onward
            movement of the Republic from its opening hour until now, but without success.</tone> The
            Republic has marched on and on, and its step has exalted freedom and humanity. <tone rhetoric="appeal_to_history">We are
            undergoing the same ordeal as did our predecessors nearly a century ago. We are
            following the course they blazed. They triumphed. Will their successors falter and plead
            organic impotency in the nation? Surely after 125 years of achievement for mankind we
            will not now surrender our equality with other powers on matters fundamental and
            essential to nationality. With no such purpose was the nation created. In no such spirit
            has it developed its full and independent sovereignty.</tone> <value type="equality">We adhere to the principle of
            equality among ourselves, and by no act of ours will we assign to ourselves a
            subordinate rank in the family of nations.</value></p>

        <p>My fellow-citizens, the public events of the past four years have gone into history. They
            are too near to justify recital. Some of them were unforeseen; many of them momentous
            and far-reaching in their consequences to ourselves and our relations with the rest of
            the world. <policy foreign="cooperation">The part which the United States bore so honorably in the thrilling scenes in
            China, while new to American life, has been in harmony with its true spirit and best
            traditions, and in dealing with the results its policy will be that of moderation and
            fairness.</policy></p>

        <p><policy foreign="intervention">We face at this moment a most important question that of the future relations of the
            United States and Cuba. With our near neighbors we must remain close friends. The
            declaration of the purposes of this Government in the resolution of April 20, 1898, must
            be made good. Ever since the evacuation of the island by the army of Spain, the
            Executive, with all practicable speed, has been assisting its people in the successive
            steps necessary to the establishment of a free and independent government prepared to
            assume and perform the obligations of international law which now rest upon the United
            States under the treaty of Paris.</policy> The convention elected by the people to frame a
            constitution is approaching the completion of its labors. The transfer of American
            control to the new government is of such great importance, <policy foreign="intervention">involving an obligation
            resulting from our intervention and the treaty of peace, that I am glad to be advised by
            the recent act of Congress of the policy which the legislative branch of the Government
            deems essential to the best interests of Cuba and the United States.</policy> The principles
            which led to our intervention require that the fundamental law upon which the new
            government rests should be adapted to secure a government capable of performing the
            duties and discharging the functions of a separate nation, of observing its
            international obligations of <value type="security">protecting life and property, insuring order, safety,</value> and
            liberty, and conforming to the established and historical policy of the United States in
            its relation to Cuba.</p>

        <p>The peace which we are pledged to leave to the Cuban people must carry with it the
            guaranties of permanence. <policy foreign="intervention">We became sponsors for the pacification of the island, and we
                remain accountable to the Cubans,</policy> no less than to our own country and people, for the
            reconstruction of Cuba as a <value type="liberty">free commonwealth on abiding foundations of right, justice,
            liberty, and assured order. Our enfranchisement of the people will not be completed
            until free Cuba shall “be a reality, not a name; a perfect entity, not a hasty
            experiment bearing within itself the elements of failure.”</value></p>

        <p>While the treaty of peace with Spain was ratified on the 6th of February, 1899, and
            ratifications were exchanged nearly two years ago, <policy foreign="intervention">the Congress has indicated no form of
                government for the Philippine Islands.</policy> <policy foreign="intervention">It has, however, provided an army to enable the
            Executive to suppress insurrection, restore peace, give security to the inhabitants, and
            establish the authority of the United States throughout the archipelago.</policy> It has
            authorized the organization of native troops as auxiliary to the regular force. It has
            been advised from time to time of the acts of the military and naval officers in the
            islands, of my action in appointing civil commissions, of the instructions with which
            they were charged, of their duties and powers, of their recommendations, and of their
            several acts under executive commission, together with the very complete general
            information they have submitted. These reports fully set forth the conditions, past and
            present, in the islands, and the instructions clearly show the principles which will
            guide the Executive until the Congress shall, as it is required to do by the treaty,
            determine “the civil rights and political status of the native inhabitants.” The
            Congress having added the sanction of its authority to the powers already possessed and
            exercised by the Executive under the Constitution, thereby leaving with the Executive
            the responsibility for the government of the Philippines, I shall continue the efforts
            already begun until order shall be restored throughout the islands, and as fast as
            conditions permit will establish local governments, in the formation of which the full
            co-operation of the people has been already invited, and when established will encourage
            the people to administer them. The settled purpose, long ago proclaimed, to afford the
            inhabitants of the islands self-government as fast as they were ready for it will be
            pursued with earnestness and fidelity. Already something has been accomplished in this
            direction. The Government’s representatives, civil and military, are doing faithful and
            noble work in their mission of emancipation and merit the approval and support of their
            countrymen. The most liberal terms of amnesty have already been communicated to the
            insurgents, and the way is still open for those who have raised their arms against the
            Government for honorable submission to its authority. Our countrymen should not be
            deceived. We are not waging war against the inhabitants of the Philippine Islands. A
            portion of them are making war against the United States. <policy foreign="intervention">By far the greater part of the
            inhabitants recognize American sovereignty and welcome it as a guaranty of order and of
            security for life, property, liberty, freedom of conscience, and the pursuit of
            happiness.</policy> To them full protection will be given. They shall not be abandoned. We will
            not leave the destiny of the loyal millions the islands to the disloyal thousands who
            are in rebellion against the United States. Order under civil institutions will come as
            soon as those who now break the peace shall keep it. Force will not be needed or used
            when those who make war against us shall make it no more. May it end without further
            bloodshed, and there be ushered in the reign of peace to be <value type="liberty">made permanent by a
                government of liberty under law!</value></p>
