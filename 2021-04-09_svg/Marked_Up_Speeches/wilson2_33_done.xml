              <p>My Fellow Citizens:</p>
              <p>The four years which have elapsed since last I stood in this place have been
                     crowded with counsel and action of the most vital interest and consequence.
                     Perhaps no equal period in our history has been so fruitful of important
                     reforms in our economic and industrial life or so full of significant changes
                     in the spirit and purpose of our political action. <policy economy="regulation">We have sought very
                     thoughtfully to set our house in order, correct the grosser errors and abuses
                     of our industrial life,</policy> <tone emotion="proud">liberate and quicken the processes of our national
                            genius and energy,</tone> and lift our politics to a broader view of the people’s
                     essential interests.</p>
              <p>It is a record of singular variety and singular distinction. But I shall not
                     attempt to review it. It speaks for itself and will be of increasing influence
                     as the years go by. This is not the time for retrospect. It is time rather to
                     speak our thoughts and purposes concerning the present and the immediate
                     future.</p>
              <p>Although we have centered counsel and action with such unusual concentration and
                     success upon the great problems of domestic legislation to which we addressed
                     ourselves four years ago, other matters have more and more forced themselves
                     upon our attention—matters lying outside our own life as a nation and over
                     which we had no control, but which, despite our wish to keep free of them, have
                     drawn us more and more irresistibly into their own current and influence.</p>
              <p>It has been impossible to avoid them. They have affected the life of the whole
                     world. They have shaken men everywhere with a passion and an apprehension they
                     never knew before. It has been hard to preserve calm counsel while the thought
                     of our own people swayed this way and that under their influence. We are a
                     composite and cosmopolitan people. We are of the blood of all the nations that
                     are at war. The currents of our thoughts as well as the currents of our trade
                     run quick at all seasons back and forth between us and them. The war inevitably
                     set its mark from the first alike upon our minds, our industries, our commerce,
                     our politics and our social action. To be indifferent to it, or independent of
                     it, was out of the question.</p>
              <p><policy foreign="isolationism">And yet all the while we have been conscious that we were not part of it.</policy> <value type="unity">In that
                     consciousness, despite many divisions, we have drawn closer together.</value> We have
                     been deeply wronged upon the seas, but we have not wished to wrong or injure in
                     return; have retained throughout the consciousness of standing in some sort
                     apart, intent upon an interest that transcended the immediate issues of the war
                     itself.</p>
              <p>As some of the injuries done us have become intolerable we have still been clear
                     that we wished nothing for ourselves that we were not ready to demand for all
                     mankind—<value type="security">fair dealing, justice, the freedom to live and to be at ease against
                            organized wrong.</value></p>
              <p>It is in this spirit and with this thought that we have grown more and more aware,
                     more and more certain that the part we wished to play was the part of those who
                     mean to <policy foreign="pacifism">vindicate and fortify peace.</policy> We have been obliged to arm ourselves to
                     make good our claim to a certain minimum of right and of freedom of action. <policy foreign="isolationism">We
                            stand firm in armed neutrality</policy> since it seems that in no other way we can
                     demonstrate what it is we insist upon and cannot forget. We may even be drawn
                     on, by circumstances, not by our own purpose or desire, to a more active
                     assertion of our rights as we see them and a more immediate association with
                     the great struggle itself. But nothing will alter our thought or our purpose.
                     They are too clear to be obscured. They are too deeply rooted in the principles
                     of our national life to be altered. We desire neither conquest nor advantage.
                     <policy foreign="pacifism">We wish nothing that can be had only at the cost of another people. We always
                     professed unselfish purpose and we covet the opportunity to prove our
                     professions are sincere.</policy></p>
              <p>There are many things still to be done at home, to clarify our own politics and add
                     new vitality to the industrial processes of our own life, and we shall do them
                     as time and opportunity serve, <tone emotion="provoking">but we realize that the greatest things that
                     remain to be done must be done with the whole world for stage and in
                     cooperation with the wide and universal forces of mankind, and we are making
                     our spirits ready for those things.</tone></p>
              <p><policy foreign="intervention"> We are provincials no longer. The tragic events of the thirty months of vital
                     turmoil through which we have just passed have made us citizens of the world.
                     There can be no turning back.</policy> Our own fortunes as a nation are involved whether
                     we would have it so or not.</p>
              <p><value type="patriotism">And yet we are not the less Americans on that account. We shall be the more
                     American if we but remain true to the principles in which we have been bred.</value>
                     They are not the principles of a province or of a single continent. <value type="liberty">We have
                     known and boasted all along that they were the principles of a liberated
                     mankind. These, therefore, are the things we shall stand for, whether in war or
                     in peace:</value></p>
              <p>That all nations are equally interested in the peace of the world and in the
                     political stability of free peoples, and equally responsible for their
                     maintenance; that the essential principle of peace is the actual equality of
                     nations in all matters of right or privilege; that peace cannot securely or
                     justly rest upon an armed balance of power; <value type="democracy">that governments derive all their
                     just powers from the consent of the governed and that no other powers should be
                     supported by the common thought,</value> purpose or power of the family of nations;
                     that the seas should be equally free and safe for the use of all peoples, under
                     rules set up by common agreement and consent, and that, so far as practicable,
                     they should be accessible to all upon equal terms; that national armaments
                     shall be limited to the necessities of national order and domestic safety; that
                     the community of interest and of power upon which peace must henceforth depend
                     imposes upon each nation the duty of seeing to it that all influences
                     proceeding from its own citizens meant to encourage or assist revolution in
                     other states should be sternly and effectually suppressed and prevented.</p>
              <p>I need not argue these principles to you, my fellow countrymen; they are your own
                     part and parcel of your own thinking and your own motives in affairs. They
                     spring up native amongst us. Upon this as a platform of purpose and of action
                     we can stand together. <value type="unity">And it is imperative that we should stand together. We
                     are being forged into a new unity amidst the fires that now blaze throughout
                     the world.</value> <value type="religion">In their ardent heat we shall, in God’s Providence,</value> <value type="unity">let us hope, be
                     purged of faction and division, purified of the errant humors of party and of
                     private interest,</value> <value type="patriotism">and shall stand forth in the days to come with a new dignity
                            of national pride and spirit.</value> <value type="individualism">Let each man see to it that the dedication is in
                     his own heart, the high purpose of the nation in his own mind, ruler of his own
                     will and desire.</value></p>
              <p><tone emotion="humble">I stand here and have taken the high and solemn oath to which you have been
                     audience because the people of the United States have chosen me for this august
                     delegation of power and have by their gracious judgment named me their leader
                     in affairs.</tone></p>
              <p>I know now what the task means. I realize to the full the responsibility which it
                            involves.<value type="religion">I pray God I may be given the wisdom and the prudence
                                   to do my duty in the true spirit of this great people.</value> <value type="democracy">I am
                     their servant and can succeed only as they sustain and guide me by their
                     confidence and their counsel.</value> The thing I shall count upon, the thing without
                     which neither counsel nor action will avail, <value type="unity">is the unity of America—an America
                     united in feeling, in purpose and in its vision of duty, of opportunity and of
                     service.</value></p>
              <p>We are to beware of all men who would turn the tasks and the necessities of the
                     nation to their own private profit or use them for the building up of private
                     power.</p>
              <p><value type="unity">United alike in the conception of our duty and in the high resolve to perform it in
                     the face of all men, let us dedicate ourselves to the great task to which we
                     must now set our hand. For myself I beg your tolerance, your countenance and
                     your united aid.</value></p>
              <p><tone emotion="inspiring">The shadows that now lie dark upon our path will soon be dispelled, and we shall
                     walk with the light all about us if we be but true to ourselves—</tone>to ourselves as
                     we have wished to be known in the counsels of the world <value type="liberty">and in the thought of
                            all those who love liberty and justice and the right exalted.</value></p>
