        <p>Citizens of the United States:</p>

        <p>Your suffrages having elected me to the office of President of the United States, I have,
            in conformity to the Constitution of our country, taken the oath of office prescribed
            therein. I have taken this oath without mental reservation and with the determination to
            do to the best of my ability all that is required of me. The responsibilities of the
            position I feel, but accept them without fear. The office has come to me unsought; I
            commence its duties untrammeled. I bring to it a conscious desire and determination to
            fill it to the best of my ability to the satisfaction of the people. </p>
        <p>On all leading questions agitating the public mind I will always express my views to
            Congress and urge them according to my judgment, and when I think it advisable will
            exercise the constitutional privilege of interposing a veto to defeat measures which I
            oppose; but all laws will be faithfully executed, whether they meet my approval or
            not.</p>

        <p>I shall on all subjects have a policy to recommend, but none to enforce against the will
            of the people. <value type="equality">Laws are to govern all alike—those
                opposed as well as those who favor them.</value> I know no method to secure the
            repeal of bad or obnoxious laws so effective as their stringent execution.</p>

        <p>The country having just emerged from a great rebellion, many questions will come before
            it for settlement in the next four years which preceding Administrations have never had
            to deal with. <tone emotion="pragmatic">In meeting these it is desirable that they should
                be approached calmly, without prejudice, hate, or sectional pride, remembering that
                the greatest good to the greatest number is the object to be attained.</tone></p>

        <p>This requires <value type="security">security of person,</value><value
                type="security"> property,</value><value type="liberty"> and free religious and
                political opinion</value> in every part of our common country, without regard to
            local prejudice. All laws to secure these ends will receive my best efforts for their
            enforcement.</p>

        <p><policy economy="debt">A great debt has been contracted in securing to us and our
                posterity the Union. The payment of this, principal and interest, as well as the
                return to a specie basis as soon as it can be accomplished without material
                detriment to the debtor class or to the country at large, must be provided
                for.</policy> To protect the national honor, every dollar of Government indebtedness
            should be paid in gold, unless otherwise expressly stipulated in the contract. Let it be
            understood that no repudiator of one farthing of our public debt will be trusted in
            public place, and it will go far toward strengthening a credit which ought to be the
            best in the world, and will ultimately enable us to replace the debt with bonds bearing
            less interest than we now pay. To this should be added a faithful collection of the
            revenue, a strict accountability to the Treasury for every dollar collected, and the
            greatest practicable retrenchment in expenditure in every department of Government. </p>
        <p>When we compare the paying capacity of the country now, with the ten States in poverty
            from the effects of war, but soon to emerge, I trust, into greater prosperity than ever
            before, with its paying capacity twenty-five years ago, and calculate what it probably
            will be twenty-five years hence, <tone emotion="confident">who can doubt the feasibility of
                paying every dollar then with more ease than we now pay for useless luxuries? Why,
                it looks as though Providence had bestowed upon us a strong box in the precious
                metals locked up in the sterile mountains of the far West, and which we are now
                forging the key to unlock, to meet the very contingency that is now upon
            us.</tone></p>

        <p>Ultimately it may be necessary to insure the facilities to reach these riches and it may
            be necessary also that the General Government should give its aid to secure this access;
            but that should only be when a dollar of obligation to pay secures precisely the same
            sort of dollar to use now, and not before. Whilst the question of specie payments is in
            abeyance the prudent business man is careful about contracting debts payable in the
            distant future. The nation should follow the same rule. <policy economy="recovery"
                >A prostrate commerce is to be rebuilt and all industries encouraged.</policy></p>

        <p>The young men of the country—those who from their age must be its rulers twenty-five
            years hence—have a peculiar interest in maintaining the national honor. A moment’s
            reflection as to what will be our commanding influence among the nations of the earth in
            their day, if they are only true to themselves, should inspire them with national pride.
            <value type="unity">All divisions—geographical, political, and religious—can join in this common sentiment.</value>
            <policy economy="debt">How the public debt is to be paid or specie payments resumed is not so important as that
                a plan should be adopted and acquiesced in.</policy><value type="unity">A united determination to do is worth more
            than divided counsels upon the method of doing. Legislation upon this subject may not be
            necessary now, or even advisable, but it will be when the civil law is more fully
            restored in all parts of the country and trade resumes its wonted channels.</value> </p>
        <p>It will be my endeavor to execute all laws in good faith, to collect all revenues
            assessed, and to have them properly accounted for and economically disbursed. I will to
            the best of my ability appoint to office those only who will carry out this design. </p>
        <p><policy foreign="cooperation">In regard to foreign policy, I would deal with nations as
                equitable law requires individuals to deal with each other, and I would protect the
                law-abiding citizen, whether of native or foreign birth, wherever his rights are
                jeopardized or the flag of our country floats.</policy> I would respect the rights
            of all nations, demanding equal respect for our own. <tone emotion="stern">If others depart
                from this rule in their dealings with us, we may be compelled to follow their
                precedent.</tone></p>
        <p>
            <policy civil_rights="native_american">The proper treatment of the original occupants of this
                land—the Indians one deserving of careful study. I will favor any course toward them
                which tends to their civilization and ultimate citizenship.</policy>
        </p>

        <p><policy civil_rights="voting">The question of suffrage is one which is likely to agitate
                the public so long as a portion of the citizens of the nation are excluded from its
                privileges in any State.</policy> It seems to me very desirable that this question
            should be settled now, and I entertain the <policy civil_rights="voting">hope and
                express the desire that it may be by the ratification of the fifteenth article of
                amendment to the Constitution.</policy></p>
        <p>
            <value type="unity">In conclusion I ask patient forbearance one toward another
                throughout the land, and a determined effort on the part of every citizen to do his
                share toward cementing a happy union; and I ask the prayers of the nation to
                Almighty God in behalf of this consummation.</value>
