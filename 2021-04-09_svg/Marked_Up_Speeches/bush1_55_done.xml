        <p>Vice President Cheney, Mr. Chief Justice, President Carter, President Bush, President
            Clinton, Members of the United States Congress, Reverend Clergy, distinguished guests,
            fellow citizens.</p>
        <p>On this day, prescribed by law and marked by ceremony, we celebrate the durable wisdom of
            our Constitution and recall the deep commitments that unite our country. I am grateful
            for the honor of this hour, mindful of the <tone emotion="stress">consequential times in
                which we live</tone>, and determined to fulfill the oath that I have sworn and you
            have witnessed.</p>
        <p>At this second gathering, our duties are defined not by the words I use, but by the
            history we have seen together. For a half century, <policy foreign="internationalism"
                >America defended its own freedom by standing watch on distant borders.</policy>
            <value type="democracy">After the shipwreck of communism came years of relative quiet,
                years of repose, years of sabbatical—and then there came a day of fire.</value></p>
        <p><tone emotion="stress">We have seen our vulnerability and we have seen its deepest
                source</tone>. <tone emotion="provoking">For as long as whole regions of the world
                simmer in resentment and tyranny, prone to ideologies that feed hatred and excuse
                murder, violence will gather and multiply in destructive power and cross the most
                defended borders and raise a mortal threat.</tone>
            <tone emotion="provoking">There is only one force of history that can break the reign of
                hatred and resentment and expose the pretensions of tyrants and reward the hopes of
                the decent and tolerant</tone>, and that is the force of human freedom.</p>
        <p>We are led, by events and common sense, to one conclusion: <policy foreign="internationalism"
                >The survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty
                in other lands</policy>. <tone emotion="provoking">The best hope for peace in our
                world</tone> is the <policy foreign="internationalism">expansion of freedom in all the
                world.</policy></p>
        <p>America’s vital interests and our deepest beliefs are now one. From the day of our
            founding, <value type="equality">we have proclaimed that every man and woman on this
                Earth has rights and dignity and matchless value</value> because they <value
                type="religion">bear the image of the Maker of heaven and Earth</value>.</p>
        <p><policy government="self_government">Across the generations we have proclaimed the imperative of self-government, because no
            one is fit to be a master, and no one deserves to be a slave</policy>.</p>
        <p>Advancing these ideals is the mission that created our Nation. <tone emotion="pride">It
                is the honorable achievement of our fathers</tone>. <tone emotion="stress">Now it is
                the urgent requirement of our Nation’s security, and the calling of our time</tone>.
                <policy foreign="internationalism">So it is the policy of the United States to seek and
                support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and
                culture, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world.</policy></p>
        <p>This is not primarily the task of arms, <policy military="war">though we will defend
                ourselves and our friends by force of arms when necessary.</policy> Freedom, by its
            nature, must be chosen and defended by citizens, and sustained by the rule of law and
            the protection of minorities. And when the soul of a nation finally speaks, the
            institutions that arise may reflect customs and traditions very different from our own.
                <policy foreign="isolationist">America will not impose its own style of government
                on the unwilling.</policy>
            <policy foreign="internationalism">Our goal instead is to help others find their own voice,
                attain their own freedom, and make their own way.</policy></p>
        <p>The great objective of <tone emotion="provoking">ending tyranny</tone> is the
            concentrated work of generations. <tone emotion="stress">The difficulty of the task is
                no excuse for avoiding it</tone>. America’s influence is not unlimited, but <tone
                emotion="pride">fortunately for the oppressed, America’s influence is considerable,
                and we will use it confidently in freedom’s cause.</tone></p>
        <p><policy terrorism="foreign">My most solemn duty is to protect this Nation and its people
                from further attacks and emerging threats.</policy> Some have unwisely chosen to
            test America’s resolve, and have found it firm. <policy foreign="internationalism">We will
                persistently clarify the choice before every ruler and every nation: The moral
                choice between oppression, which is always wrong, and freedom, which is eternally
                right. America will not pretend that jailed dissidents prefer their chains, or that
                women welcome humiliation and servitude, or that any human being aspires to live at
                the mercy of bullies. We will encourage reform in other governments by making clear
                that success in our relations will require the decent treatment of their own
                people</policy>.</p>
        <p><value type="equality">America’s belief in human dignity will guide our policies, yet
                rights must be more than the grudging concessions of dictators; they are secured by
                free dissent and the participation of the governed.</value>
            <value type="democracy">In the long run, there is no justice without freedom, and there
                can be no human rights without human liberty</value>.</p>
        <p>Some, I know, have questioned the global appeal of liberty—although this time in history,
            four decades defined by the swiftest advance of freedom ever seen, is an odd time for
            doubt. Americans, of all people, should never be surprised by the power of our ideals.
            Eventually, the call of freedom comes to every mind and every soul. <tone
                emotion="provoking"> We do not accept the existence of permanent tyranny because we
                do not accept the possibility of permanent slavery.</tone></p>
        <p><policy foreign="internationalism">Liberty will come to those who love it. Today, America
                speaks anew to the peoples of the world. All who live in tyranny and hopelessness
                can know the United States will not ignore your oppression, or excuse your
                oppressors. When you stand for your liberty, we will stand with you.</policy></p>
        <p><policy foreign="internationalism">Democratic reformers facing repression, prison, or exile
                can know America sees you for who you are, the future leaders of your free
                country.</policy> The rulers of outlaw regimes can know that <tone
                rhetoric="appeal_to_past">we still believe as Abraham Lincoln did: “Those who deny
                freedom to others deserve it not for themselves; and, under the rule of a just God,
                cannot long retain it.”</tone></p>
        <p>The leaders of governments with long habits of control need to know: To serve your people
            you must learn to trust them. Start on this journey of progress and justice, and <policy
                foreign="internationalism">America will walk at your side. All the allies of the United
                States can know we honor your friendship, we rely on your counsel, and we depend on
                your help</policy>. Division among free nations is a primary goal of freedom’s
            enemies. <value type="democracy">The concerted effort of free nations to promote
                democracy is a prelude to our enemies’ defeat.</value></p>
        <p>Today, I also speak anew to my fellow citizens. From all of you, I have asked patience in
            the hard task of securing America, which you have granted in good measure. Our country
            has accepted obligations that are difficult to fulfill, and would be dishonorable to
            abandon. Yet because we have acted in the great liberating tradition of this Nation,
            tens of millions have achieved their freedom.</p>
        <p><tone emotion="optimistic">As hope kindles hope, millions more will find it. By our
                efforts, we have lit a fire as well—a fire in the minds of men. It warms those who
                feel its power, it burns those who fight its progress, and one day this untamed fire
                of freedom will reach the darkest corners of our world.</tone></p>
        <p><policy foreign="internationalism">A few Americans have accepted the hardest duties in this
                cause—in the quiet work of intelligence and diplomacy; the idealistic work of
                helping raise up free governments; the dangerous and necessary work of fighting our
                enemies.</policy>
            <value type="patriotism">Some have shown their devotion to our country in deaths that
                honored their whole lives</value>, <tone emotion="mourning">and we will always honor
                their names and their sacrifice</tone>.</p>
        <p>All Americans have witnessed this idealism, and some for the first time. I ask our
            youngest citizens to believe the evidence of your eyes. You have seen duty and
            allegiance in the determined faces of our soldiers. <tone emotion="optimistic">You have
                seen that life is fragile, evil is real, and courage triumphs.</tone> Make the
            choice to serve in a cause larger than your wants, larger than yourself, and in your
            days you will add not just to the wealth of our country, but to its character.</p>
        <p>America has need of idealism and courage, because we have essential work at home—the
            unfinished work of American freedom. <value type="action">In a world moving toward
                liberty, we are determined to show the meaning and promise of liberty</value>.
                <value type="democracy">In America’s ideal of freedom, citizens find the dignity and
                security of economic independence, instead of laboring on the edge of subsistence.
                This is the broader definition of liberty that motivated the Homestead Act, the
                Social Security Act, and the G.I. Bill of Rights. And now we will extend this vision
                by reforming great institutions to serve the needs of our time.</value>
            <policy education="school">To give every American a stake in the promise and future of
                our country, we will bring the highest standards to our schools, and build an
                ownership society.</policy></p>
        <p><policy economy="property">We will widen the ownership of homes and businesses,
                retirement savings</policy>, and <policy health="health_care">health
                insurance</policy>, preparing our people for the challenge of life in a free
            society. By making every citizen an agent of his or her own destiny, we will give our
            fellow Americans greater freedom from want and fear, and make our society more
            prosperous and just and equal.</p>
        <p>In America’s ideal of freedom, the public interest depends on private character—on
            integrity, <value type="equality">and tolerance towards others</value>, and the rule of
            conscience in our own lives. <policy government="self_government">Self-government relies, in the end, on the governing of the
                self</policy>. That edifice of character is built in families, supported by communities with
            standards, and sustained in our national life by the <value type="religion">truths of
                Sinai, the Sermon on the Mount, the words of the Koran, and the varied faiths of our
                people</value>. Americans move forward in every generation by reaffirming all that
            is good and true that came before—ideals of justice and conduct that are the same
            yesterday, today, and forever.</p>
        <p>In America’s ideal of freedom, the exercise of rights is ennobled by service, mercy, and
            a heart for the weak. Liberty for all does not mean independence from one another.
                <value type="unity">Our Nation relies on men and women who look after a neighbor and
                surround the loss with love</value>. Americans, at our best, value the life we see
            in one another, and must always remember that even the unwanted have worth.</p>
        <p><value type="equality">Our country must abandon all the habits of racism because we
                cannot carry the message of freedom and the baggage of bigotry at the same
                time</value>. From the perspective of a single day, including this day of
            dedication, the issues and questions before our country are many. <tone
                rhetoric="appeal_to_future">From the viewpoint of centuries, the questions that come
                to us are narrowed and few. Did our generations advance the cause of freedom</tone>?
            And did our character bring credit to that cause?</p>
        <p><value type="unity">These questions that judge us also unite us, because Americans of
                every party and background, Americans by choice and by birth, are bound to one
                another in the cause of freedom</value>. We have known divisions which must be
            healed to move forward in great purposes, and I will strive in good faith to heal them.
            Yet those divisions do not define America. We felt the unity and fellowship of our
            Nation when <policy terrorism="foreign">freedom came under attack, and our response came
                like a single hand over a single heart</policy>. <value type="unity">We can feel
                that same unity and pride whenever America acts for good</value>, and the victims of
            disaster are given hope, and the unjust encounter justice, and the captives are set
            free.</p>
        <p><tone emotion="pride">We go forward with complete confidence in the eventual triumph of
                freedom</tone>. Not because history runs on the wheels of inevitability; it is human
            choices that move events. Not because we consider ourselves a chosen nation; <value
                type="religion">God moves and chooses as He wills</value>. <tone
                emotion="optimistic">We have confidence because freedom is the permanent hope of
                mankind, the hunger and dark places, the longing of the soul</tone>. <tone
                rhetoric="appeal_to_past">When our Founders declared a new order of the ages, when
                soldiers died in wave upon wave for a union based on liberty, when citizens marched
                in peaceful outrage under the banner “Freedom Now,” they were acting on ancient hope
                that is meant to be fulfilled</tone>. History has an ebb and flow of justice, but
            history also has a visible direction, set by liberty and the Author of Liberty.</p>
        <p><tone rhetoric="appeal_to_past">When the Declaration of Independence was first read in
                public and the Liberty Bell was sounded in celebration, a witness said, “It rang as
                if it meant something.”</tone> In our time, it means something still. <policy
                foreign="internationalism">America, in this young century, proclaims liberty throughout
                the world, and to all the inhabitants thereof</policy>. Renewed in our
            strength—tested but not weary—<tone emotion="optimistic">we are ready for the greatest
                achievements in the history of freedom</tone>.</p>
        <p>
            <value type="religion">May God bless you, and may He watch over the United States of
                America</value>. </p>
