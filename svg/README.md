# Stooge SVG

The XSLT in this directory (*stooge-dynamic.xsl*) can be used to transform the XML (*stooge.xml*) into the SVG (*stooge-dynamic.svg*). 

This SVG is similar to what students create manually as a first SVG activity in our course, to familiarize themselves with the general SVG infrastructure, and with SVG rectangles, lines, and text. The files here illustrate how to use XSLT to perform the same task. The XSLT is commented for pedagogical purposes; please pose any questions by opening GitHub Issues in this repo.
